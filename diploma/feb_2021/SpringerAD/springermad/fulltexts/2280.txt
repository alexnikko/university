Introduction
DNA injury or failure of DNA repair mechanisms contributes to degenerative forms of aging (Garinis et al. ). Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is a common birth anomaly associated with a high risk of age typical diseases such as dementia and cancer (Head et al. ). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE2) are expressed on chromosome 21 (Glenner and Wong ; Roizen and Patterson ), and both are related to accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. Chromosome 21 carries also genes responsible for de novo purine synthesis (GART) (Aimi et al. ), folate transport (i.e., folate transporter 1, SLC19A1), homocysteine transsulfuration (CBS), and methyl transfer such as protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT2) and DNA methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L). Trisomy 21 affects the transfer of one-carbon units between folate and methionine pathways and disturbs the methylation cycle (Obeid et al. ; Obermann-Borst et al. ; Pogribna et al. ). Thus, epigenetic changes and accelerated aging could be triggered by altered methyl metabolism in DS.
Methylation of cytosine within CpG dinucleotides is a dynamic mechanism of gene regulation. DNA methylation (DNAm) and demethylation are strictly coordinated. Aging is associated with a genome wide decrease in DNAm (Bollati et al. ), while some gene-specific CpG dinucleotides located in the promoters of genes become hypermethylated with age (Kane et al. ; Weidner and Wagner ). Epigenetic mechanisms can drive age-related diseases, such as cancer and dementia, but are also known to be operating at early life thus affecting neurodevelopment and brain functions. DNAm changes throughout life, but it can differ between adult and children (Alisch et al. ). A childhood-specific DNAm has been shown and proposed to continue throughout life with a slower rate of change during adulthood (Alisch et al. ).
Aging, DNAm and repair, and Aβ metabolism (i.e., 3 components of DS) have been related to one-carbon metabolism (Fuso et al. ). Recent studies in adults suggested that DNAm pattern of only 3 CpGs can predict the age of an individual (Weidner et al. ). Predicting accelerated aging through testing only few epigenetic markers in blood is an innovative approach that intends at stratifying subjects according to their risk of age-associated diseases. The current study tested the hypothesis that DNAm is associated with aging and metabolic abnormalities in young individuals with DS.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The current study included a group of 60 elderly subjects [mean ± standard deviation (SD) = 68 ± 10 years] who were recruited as part of a study on the effect of vitamin supplementation on bone markers (primary outcomes) and epigenetic markers (secondary outcomes) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID; NCT02586181) (Hübner et al. ).
Moreover, young subjects with DS [mean age ± SD = 12.1 ± 9.8 years, n = 31] and young control subjects without any chromosomal anomalies [age = 12.8 ± 5.0 years, n = 44] were studied. The control individuals were free of chronic diseases or infections and were not using any medications. The original study population has been described before (Obeid et al. ). The current study included 75 subjects where DNA samples were available. The exclusion criteria for the young groups were: serious clinical conditions, recent surgery, methotrexate treatment, and current vitamin usage.
The studies were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Saarland. A written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children or from the adult participants.
Fasting blood (2–8 h) was collected on EDTA-containing tubes or dry tubes. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 g and 4 °C, serum and EDTA plasma were separated within 30 min, and several aliquots were prepared and kept at −70 °C until analysis. All blood biomarkers were measured within 1 year of blood collection.
Methods
We investigated the sequences surrounding ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C, three CpGs that have been reported to predict aging in adults (Weidner et al. ). Methylations of ASPA and ITGA2B correlated with age also in a study on children (Alisch et al. ). We investigated the three CpGs for locus-specific DNAm by bisulfite method followed by pyrosequencing. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA whole blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany; GYN). 0.5 µg DNA was diluted with 20 µl nuclease-free water, and bisulfide conversion was conducted for 2 h using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH CORP) that depends on temperature denaturation of DNA and bisulfite conversion in one step. Cytosine in DNA is converted to uracil through its reaction with sodium bisulfite. Subsequently, the bisulfite product was amplified by PCR and the methylation of the three CpGs in the PCR product was performed by pyrosequencing using the PSQ96 MA System (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The sequencing and annealing primers were described by Weidner et al. (Weidner et al. ) (Supplemental Table 1). Annealing was performed for 3 min at 70 °C. Analysis of sequencing data was performed with PSQ MA software version 2.1.
DNAm Assay Quality Control
A pool of several DNAs was prepared and was run each time with the samples to control for day-to-day variations of the assay. The between-days coefficient of variations (CVs %) for the DNAm assay was calculated based on pool DNA samples measured on 18 independent days. The CV % of the assay was <3 % for ASPA and ITGA2B, and 7.6 % for PDE4C gene (Supplemental Table 2).
Soluble Blood Biomarkers
The concentrations of S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), choline, and betaine were measured in EDTA plasma and vitamin B12, and total homocysteine (Hcy) was measured in serum samples as described earlier (Obeid et al. ). Concentrations of amyloid beta (1-42) were measured in EDTA-plasma samples using a high sensitive ELISA assay (Innogenetics®).
Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were tested for normal distribution using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and Lilliefors significance correction. Log transformation was applied for all variables that were not normally distributed. Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Continuous variables were compared between the controls and DS group by using t test for independent groups applied on the log-transformed data. General linear model univariate analysis of variance test was applied in Table 2 for adjusting for age that was entered as co-variate. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Correlations between different markers were investigated using Spearman Rho test.
We calculated standardized z -scores for DNAm of the three genes. Subsequently, we created a new variable by adding z -scores for ASPA and ITGA2B, that both decrease with age. A further variable was created by adding z -scores for DNAm of the three CpGs. Z-score is a standardized value assigned to a variable where the group mean is considered to have a value of zero and each 1 SD above or below the zero indicates 1 score (+1, −1, respectively).
A stepwise multiple regression analysis was applied to instruct an age-predicting formula from the control group and a separate one from DS. For the preliminary stepwise regression analyses, we considered DNAm in addition to available soluble markers and we then eliminated the irrelevant biomarkers in the following models until getting a final model. DNAm values and soluble biomarkers were entered in the regression as log-transformed data to correct for skewed distribution. In the regression formula that was based on the data of the controls, two CpGs were strong and highly significant predictors of age in the controls: ITGA2B (cg25809905, a negative predictor) and PDE4C (cg17861230, a positive predictor). The formula that was based on data from DS incorporated also DNAm of ASPA as a significant negative predictor of age.
Stepwise regression analyses were also applied to find predictors of the DNAm of each of the three CpG sites (dependent variables) in the whole group. Independent variables included concentrations of soluble biomarkers (as log-transformed continuous variables) and DS (yes = 1 and no = 0) as a dichotomous variable. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows software (SPSS Inc.). p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant, and p values between 0.05 and 0.10 were interpreted as tendency.
Results
DNAm in Young and Elderly Subjects
DNAm of ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C were investigated in a group of 60 elderly people and compared with DNAm of the young control subjects without any chromosomal abnormality. The DNAm percentages of ASPA (mean 60.5 ± 10.3 vs. 82.9 ± 3.9 %) and ITGA2B (60.2 ± 8.1 vs. 73.9 ± 5.5 %) were lower in the elderly and showed a negative correlation with age. In contrast, the methylation of PDE4C was higher in the elderly than in young subjects (38.7 ± 6.4 vs. 16.7 ± 3.8 %), but showed a positive correlation with age (Fig. 1 ).

Soluble Biomarkers and DNAm in Down Syndrome and Control Subjects
Plasma concentrations of SAM and SAH were higher, and Hcy and SAM/SAH ratio were lower in individuals with DS compared with the controls (Table 1 ). Plasma choline tended to be higher in the DS group. Plasma concentrations of Aβ 1-42 were higher in DS compared with the controls. Mean age and percentage of boys did not differ between the groups (Table 1 ).

Methylation of ASPA tended to be lower in DS (mean = 80.7 vs. 82.9 %; p = 0.092). This difference was highly significant after adjusting for age (Table 2 ). DNAm of ITGA2B was significantly lower in subjects with DS, and DNAm of PDE4C did not differ between the two groups.

Since ASPA and ITGA2B were lower in DS and both showed marked negative associations with age, we calculated the sum of z -scores for ASPA and ITGA2B. The sum of ASPA and ITGA2B z -scores was markedly lower in DS compared with the controls [mean difference (95 % confidence intervals, CI) = −1.01 (−1.93, −0.20)] (Table 2 ). The sum of z -scores of all three locations differed significantly between the groups [mean difference = −1.23 (−1.97, −0.48)]. The ratio of methylation of genes that decrease with age (ASPA and ITGA2B) to the methylation of PDE4C that increases with age did not differ between the groups (Table 2 ).
Predictors of Age Based on DNAm and Soluble Blood Markers
Predictors of age (as a dependent variable) were determined based on stepwise regression models that included DNAm and soluble blood biomarkers among DS and controls. The predictors of age in the controls were: log-PDE4C (positive) and log-ITGA2B and log-Aβ (negative predictors). The predictors of age in DS were: log-PDE4C (positive) and log-ITGA2B, log-ASPA, and log-Aβ (negative predictors) according to the following regression equation (Eq. 1 , regression based on the controls): $${\text{Predicted}}\,{\text{age}}\,{\text{in}}\,{\text{the}}\,{\text{controls}} = 101.5 \;({\text{constant}}) + 30.2*({ \log } \text{-} {\text{PDE}}4{\text{C}})-57.4*({ \log }\text{-}{\text{ITGA2B}}) - 17.9*({ \log }\text{-}{\text{A}}\upbeta).$$ (1)
The adjusted R -square for this model was 0.645. If Aβ was not entered as a dependent variable, the R -square slightly declined, but the same DNAm predictors remained highly significant.
The equation from DS group included additionally ASPA methylation as a strong negative predictor of age (Eq. 2 , regression based on DS): $${\text{Predicted}}\,{\text{age}}\,{\text{in}}\,{\text{DS}} = 246.3 \;({\text{constant}}) + 16.1*({ \log } \text{-} {\text{PDE4C}}) -79.6*({ \log }\text{-}{\text{ASPA}}) - 41.1*({ \log }\text{-}{\text{ITGA2B}}) -20.6*({ \log }\text{-}{\text{A}}\upbeta).$$ (2)
The adjusted R -square for the regression model in DS was 0.881.
Table 3 shows means of chronological age and predicted ages calculated based on the regression model of the controls and DS. Using the regression of the controls, the predicted age of individuals with DS was on average 3.1 years lower than their chronological age. The difference between the predicted and chronological ages of DS and control subjects was 3.1 (95 % confidence intervals CI 1.5–4.6) years (Table 3 ). Using the regression model of DS, the controls would be 2.7 (95 % CI 3.9, 1.6) years older than their chronological age (Table 3 ). Supplemental Figure 1 illustrates the chronological age of DS and control subjects and the predicted age of each of them based on the regression of their counterparts.

Associations Between DNAm, Age, and Soluble Blood Biomarkers in Young Subjects
Age showed a moderate inverse correlation with DNAm of both ASPA and ITGA2B in the controls, but strong inverse correlations with these markers in DS. DNAm of PDE4C showed a stronger association with age among DS than among the control subjects (Table 4 ). Age correlated with plasma concentrations of Aβ 1-42 in the DS group (correlation coefficient r = −0.910, p < 0.001) and in the controls ( r = −0.461, p = 0.003). In DS, plasma concentrations of Aβ 1-42 correlated with DNAm of ASPA and ITGA2B (both direct correlations) and that of PDE4C (inverse correlations). The correlations between plasma Aβ 1-42 and DNAm were not significant in the controls, and they were not significant after adjusting for age in DS, suggesting that they were driven by age.

Predictors of DNAm in Young Subjects
We applied stepwise multiple regression analyses to study predictors of DNAm of ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C (dependent variables) in the 75 young participants (Table 5 ). The group (DS = 1, control = 0) was entered as a dichotomous variable, and all other continuous variables were entered as log-transformed data. Age, SAH, and choline were significant negative predictors of ASPA methylation; age, SAH, and the presence of DS were significant negative predictors of ITGA2B methylation; and age was the only significant positive predictor of PDE4C methylation.

Discussion
Premature aging is a hallmark of trisomy 21 (Jenkins et al. ; Mann ; Obermann-Borst et al. ). We have shown that subjects with DS in their second decade were on average 3.1 (95 % CI 1.5–4.6) years older than their predicted age based on regression extrapolated from their counterparts without DS. In contrast, control subjects were predicted to be 2.7 (95 % CI 3.9, 1.6) years older than their chronological age, if a regression model of DS was used. The age of subjects with DS was predicted by DNAm of only 3 loci in combination with plasma concentrations of Aβ 1-42, which together explained 88.1 % of age variations between DS subjects (adjusted R -square = 0.881). The methylations of two genes that become hypomethylated at higher age (i.e., ASPA and ITGA2B) were associated with higher concentration of plasma SAH, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases (Fig. 1 ).
Down Syndrome, Age, and DNAm of ASPA, ITGA2B, and PDE4C
Methylations of ASPA and ITGA2B genes were lower in DS compared with the controls, and they showed a strong negative association with age. However, other sites on each of these genes could be differently methylated. Our study cannot rule out altered gene functions. ASPA gene encodes aspartoacylase that enhances deacetylation of N -acetylaspartic acid to acetate and l -aspartate. The enzyme maintains an intact white matter in the brain. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a decrease in N -acetylaspartic acid/creatine ratio in brain of children with Down syndrome (Smigielska-Kuzia et al. ) and in subjects who progress from mild cognitive dysfunction to Alzheimer disease (Walecki et al. ). ITGA2B gene encodes integrin alpha-IIb, a protein with hematopoietic properties that enables platelet aggregation by enhancing platelets interaction and binding fibrinogen. ITGA2B methylation has been related to cancer (Ge et al. ; Nones et al. ), though a direct link to Down syndrome has not been shown yet.
The methylation of PDE4C did not differ between the 2 young groups, but it showed a strong positive association with age. This gene encodes cyclic AMP-specific 3′,5′-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4C that is responsible for hydrolysis of 3′,5′-cyclic AMP to adenosine 5′-phosphate, an important step in synthesis of AMP from cyclic AMP and a part of purine metabolism. Inhibitors of PDE4C gene product are used as anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator drugs, and some reports pointed out to relationship with cancer and dementia (Fusco and Giampa ).
DNAm and Accelerated Age in Down Syndrome
The age-associated decreases in methylation of ASPA and ITGA2B and the increase in methylation of PDE4C in our study confirm the original report in adults (Weidner et al. ). DNAm of ITGA2B and PDE4C was used as aging markers that showed association with smoking and alcohol consumption (Endo et al. ). Methylation of ASPA and ITGA2B showed a negative correlation with age in a study on healthy children, which is in line with our results (Alisch et al. ).
An accelerated aging in DS between 2.8 and 11.5 years was reported by Horvath et al. who measured methylations of numerous CpG loci (Horvath et al. ). We measured methylation of only 3 CpG loci, and our estimates of accelerated age in DS [mean 3.1 (95 % CI 1.5–4.6)] are comparable with those of Horvath et al. ( ). The small differences in the aging estimates between the studies could be related to participant characteristics, using different epigenetic markers, and/or combining these markers with blood biomarkers in our case.
Epigenetic Markers and Blood Markers of the Methylation Cycle
The results have several implications on health and diseases. Hypomethylation of different targeted genes has been reported in subjects with DS (Bacalini et al. ). Other studies reported a global increase of DNAm (Sailani et al. ) or a link between DNAm and DS phenotypes (Sailani et al. ). Trisomy 21 is associated with upregulation of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3B and DNMT3L) and down regulation of DNA demethylation enzymes (TET2 and TET3) (Sailani et al. ). Results on DNA hypo- and hypermethylation in DS may appear to be contradicted. However, disturbed SAM and SAH could have a key role in regulation of gene methylation in DS. If high SAH in DS could accelerate aging by causing DNA hypomethylation through competitive inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, therefore, modifications of the transmethylation pathway are likely to affect DNAm. We have previously predicted that DS resembles a metabolic disorder that might need special dietary recommendations (Obeid et al. ). If SAM/SAH ratio can be altered, they may be able to balance DNA methylation (hypo- and hyper-) and slow accelerated aging. However, this hypothesis needs to be proven in clinical studies.
Perspectives of Epigenetic Markers in Risk Stratification
An epigenetic clock has been developed and applied on different biosamples from subjects with DS (Horvath et al. ). The epigenetic clock showed similar patterns in blood and brain samples, suggesting that blood epigenetic markers may mirror brain aging (Horvath et al. ). Thus, using whole blood DNAm optimally combined with blood biomarkers could be a sensitive test to diagnose brain aging. An intriguing question is whether epigenetic markers can be linked to the nature, stage, or severity of diseases. An early diagnosis approach based on combining simple epigenetic and soluble markers could be a step toward personalized medicine, particularly if a targeted therapy can be provided to withhold the progression of a disease.
Conclusions
Our study using a compact DNAm of three CpG sites combined with plasma concentrations of Aβ 1-42 has shown that young subjects with DS were on average 3.1 years older than their predicted age. Subjects with DS showed hypomethylation of 2 genes (ASPA, and ITGA2B) compared with the controls. A 3-year accelerated aging in DS in their second decade was explained by hypomethylation of ASPA, and ITGA2B, in addition to hypermethylation of PDE4C and higher plasma Aβ 1-42. It remains open whether metabolic imbalances in the methionine cycle in DS are modifiable and whether this approach can affect DNAm.
