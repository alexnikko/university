Introduction
Oral cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers arising from different parts of the oral cavity, with different predisposing factors, prevalence, and treatment outcomes. It is the sixth most common cancer reported globally with an annual incidence of over 300,000 cases, of which 62 % arise in developing countries [ ]. There is a significant difference in the incidence of oral cancer in different regions of the world, with the age-adjusted rates varying from over 20 per 100,000 of population in India. In comparison with the US population, where oral cavity cancer represents only about 3 % of malignancies, it accounts for over 30 % of all cancers in India [ ].
The proven risk factors of oral cavity squamous cell cancer (OCSCC) are tobacco, smoking [ ], betel quid/pan masala chewing [ ], and alcohol drinking [ ]. While human papilloma virus (HPV) is an important cause of head and neck cancer (HNC) especially oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), it is currently unclear whether the HPV may also have a plausible role in other HNC subsites including OCSCC. A specific role was hypothesized way back in 1983, but till date, a definite consensus still awaits the light of the day [ , , ]. The healthy adult population has showed prevalence for any HPV type of 2–8 % in OCSCC [ , , , , , ] with a higher preponderance for male sex worldwide [ , , , ] whereas previous Indian studies have reported a wide variation in HPV positivity prevalence from northeastern, eastern, and southern different regions of the country [ , , , , ]. Further high-risk sexual behavior including oral genital sex and multiple sexual partners has been found to be associated with HPV transmission [ , , ]. Immunodeficiency states and smoking seem to increase the risk of HPV transmission [ ]. Patients with HPV-positive HNC in general tend to be younger (<50 years) at time of diagnosis [ , ] and generally have a better survival and favorable prognosis compared to HPV-negative patients [ , , , , ].
Given the increasing incidence of HPV-related HNC, studying the factors that influence quality of life (QOL) will become more important, as these patients are younger and more likely to survive than patients with HNC unrelated to HPV. Understanding the relationship between HPV status and QOL could help clinicians customize therapy and clinical management of HNC patients to optimize both survival and QOL.
Therefore, the present study aims to explore of HPV prevalence in OCSCC and its association with various risk factors and clinical and demographic variables in Northern India. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time from India, this study relates the association of change in quality of life posttreatment with HPV status during OCSCC management.
Methodology
The study was done in the Department of Surgery, King George’s Medical University UP Lucknow, in collaboration with the Department of Pathology, RML Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow UP. A total of 43 clinically and histologically proven cases of OCSCC were included prospectively in the study from August 2013 to August 2014. Tissue biopsies were collected after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (vide no. 65th ECM II-C/P4) and written informed consent from the patients.
Sample Collection
Tissue biopsies were collected in 10 % buffered formalin at room temperature for histopathological diagnosis and in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C for molecular analysis. The demographic and clinical details of the patients were recorded on the prestructured questionnaire.
OCSCC patients were staged according to UICC 7th AJCC staging. Patients were treated as per standard NCCN protocols. QOL was assessed using the University of Washington (UW_QOL) questionnaire, which was filled before at admission and after 3 months of completion of treatment.
DNA Extraction
The DNA from biopsy tissues was isolated by commercially available Purelink-Invitrogen Genomic DNA Mini kit (catalog number K1820–01) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was eluted in 80 μl of the elution buffer (provided in the kit) and kept at −80 °C until further use. All the DNA samples were qualitatively confirmed on 0.8 % agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration and purity was checked by DS-11 spectrophotometer (Denovix, USA) at 260/280 nm wavelengths.
Real-Time PCR-Based Methodology for HPV Detection
Presence of HPV in OCSCC samples was detected by real-time PCR (Biorad CFX 96TM) using 13 high-risk HPV real-time PCR kits (Hybribio Limited, China) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each PCR reaction contained 17.5 μl of PCR master mix, 0.5 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, and 2 μl of DNA. The PCR amplification protocol was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles of denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C, annealing for 60s at 60 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 20s. The amplification was followed by a 5-s final extension step at 38 °C. The presence or absence of HPV DNA was confirmed by the Ct values obtained for the sample.
Quality of Life Analysis
The patients received radiotherapy or surgery followed by chemoradiation as treatment modalities. QOL was assessed using the UW_QOL questionnaire [ ] for head and neck cancer patients, which was administered pretreatment and 3 months post treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Data was stored and analyzed on SSPS version 17.0 using chi-squared test, paired t test, and Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
Demographic and Clinicopathological Profile
Mean age of subjects was 45.56 ± 10.04 years. Of the patients, 58.1 % were below 50 years of age and 86 % patients were males; 79.1 % patients belonged to a rural background, and 97.7 % were Hindus. The patients of OCSCC had one or more addictions viz. 58.1 % were smokers, 48.8 % chewed pan masala , 58.1 % chewed tobacco, and 27.9 % consumed alcohol. The most common tumor subsite was gingivo-buccal sulcus seen in 39.5 % subjects, followed by lateral border of tongue in 27.9 % subjects. Histopathological analysis showed that 93 % patients had invasive squamous cell carcinoma while 7 % had verrucous carcinoma. Of the tumors, 69.8 % were well-differentiated. Majority of the patients, i.e., 55.8 %, belonged to TNM stage III. Of the recruited patients, 55.8 % were in a monogamous relationship and 60.5 % never reportedly had an oro-genital contact.
HPV Status
HPV presence was confirmed in only three patients (7.0 %). Table 1 summarizes the clinical, histopathological, demographic, and behavioral characteristics of patients with reference to HPV status. HPV positivity did not find any statistical correlation with age, gender, residence, addiction habit, stage, tumor size, nodal status, tumor grade, and number of sexual contacts.

Quality of Life
There was significant change in pain, activity, swallowing, chewing, taste, saliva, mood, speech, and shoulder from pretreatment to posttreatment. However, there was no significant ( p > 0.05) difference in the average percent change in QOL parameters from pretreatment to posttreatment when correlated with HPV status (Table 2 ).

Discussion
HPV has been reported as an etiological agent in the carcinogenesis of HNC especially OPC more so in western literature [ , , , ]. These HPV-positive HNC have also been observed to have a different subset of clinicopathological characteristics and preferably good response to treatment modalities [ , , , , ]. A few Indian studies have also reported the incidence of HPV in various head and neck cancer across different parts of India [ , , , , ]. In India, tobacco-related OCSCC still remains the most common neoplastic lesion causing grave morbidity [ ]. Although the association of HPV-positive OCSCC has been observed in quite a few studies with young age and no history of tobacco/alcohol use, this assumption does not seem to hold true for Indian OCSCC patients [ ]. Moreover, numerous studies have reported HPV DNA detection in oral cancer with varying rates, the detection techniques included in situ hybridization and southern blot hybridization (lower sensitivity) or PCR (high sensitivity methods) [ ].
The overall prevalence of HPV-associated OCSCC worldwide varies from 0 to 30 %. Mentioning region wise, Indian studies have reported a wide variation in expression of prevalence of HPV-associated OCSCC between 15 and 70.6 % in northeast, eastern, and southern parts [ , , , , ]. Our study stated positivity rate of 4 % in Northern India, which is low, compared to other parts of India.
In other parts of the body such as genital tract, HPV infects exclusively the basal cells of the epithelium, where the virus can remain latent. There is evidence that HPV also infects the gingival tissue with periodontal pocket; the only location that is exposed to the external environment [ , , ].
Wide-ranging studies analyzing large number of patients and describing anatomic subsites, as well HPV DNA frequency per site, indicate that HPV can be found in any of the subsites [ , , , , , , , ]. Subsite frequencies are varying between studies, but floor of mouth (9–42 %) and the tongue (8–25 %) seem to be predominantly infected by HPV. Though HPV DNA is present in a reasonable subgroup of OCSCC, it has been shown that not all of HPV DNA-positive tumors can be regarded as etiologically HPV driven [ , , ].
Literature is present for the association of HPV-positive OPC with younger age and sexual contact. HPV-associated OPC has distinct clinical, pathological, molecular, and epidemiologic features [ ]. Our data show that HPV-related OCSCC similarly has predilection for younger age (all positive were <50 years of age) and male gender. Pathologically, all HPV-positive tumors were well differentiated. The HPV positivity in OCSCC was minute in the study that may have confounded the role of sexual contact, pan masala, tobacco, smoking, and alcohol as risk factors for HPV infection.
There is conflicting data on the association of tobacco with HPV infection [ , ]. We observed in our data that tobacco consumption in any form is a risk factor, and offenders have higher rate of HPV infection. Nicotine modifying antigen-mediated signaling pathways leading to alterations in immune functions may lead to increased chances of viral infection [ ]. Conversely, in the present study, we could not clearly show the association of HPV positivity with alcohol consumption. But, in recent studies, we have shown that alcohol intake was associated with significantly increased risk of HPV infection in men [ , ]. We therefore suggest that consumption of tobacco and alcohol leads to increased vulnerability for HPV infection in Indians, same as worldwide.
Some research groups have advocated that HPV-positive and negative HNC cases should not only be considered on the basis of clinicopathological entities but also on the basis of response to different treatment modalities [ , , ]. Several studies have shown that patients with HPV-positive OPC have a significantly improved overall and disease-free survival compared to patients with HPV-negative OPC patients [ , , , , , , , ]. HPV-positive OPC patients have a better prognosis because of varied reasons including harboring fewer or different genetic alterations, which can be associated with better response to therapy [ , ], having higher radiosensitivity, probably due to intact apoptotic response to radiation [ , ], absence of field cancerization [ ], and immunologic response playing a role in the improved response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy [ , ], and lastly, association of younger age, good performance status, and fewer comorbidities may also contribute to improved survival [ ]. All these data suggest that HPV status can be used in the clinical decision-making practices to less intensify the treatment offered to this particular subset of patients. In contrast to the clear picture in OPC [ , , ], where the prognostic relevance of biologically active HPV infection is established, no such clear association has been found in OCSCC. Published literature is divided between the improved likelihood for HPV-positive OCSCC on one hand [ , ] and worst outcome on the other [ , , ] with no clout on patient survival [ , , ].
Patients with HPV-related HNC have higher rates of survival, which has been assumed to be at least partially due to an increased responsiveness in this subset with unique tumor biology. Given the improved survival in patients with HPV-related HNC, it has been suggested that patients with HPV-positive tumors would have better QOL trails. Surprisingly, the published literature seems not to fall in line with this understanding. In a principal report, Sharma et al. [ ] did not find a difference in 1-year posttreatment QOL or change in QOL from pretreatment to 1-year posttreatment by HPV status in patients of OCSCC and OPC combined. However, they found that patient with HPV tumors had higher pre treatment QOL and a greater decrease in QOL from pretreatment to immediate posttreatment. On multivariate analysis controlling for tumor site, this association did not remain significant. Lately, Maxwell et al. [ ] determined the posttreatment QOL (using same questionnaire as our study) in the head and neck cancer (including OCSCC and OPC) patients, classifying by HPV status and primary treatment modality (surgical vs nonsurgical) and showed that HPV patients had better QOL scores in speech ( P = 0.0009), chewing ( P = 0.0004), and swallowing ( P = 0.021) after 1 year posttreatment compared to HPV-negative patients. Primary treatment modality did not affect overall QOL or any of the QOL categories in HPV-positive patients. In our study though, there was no statistical difference in QOL parameters (pain, appearance, activity, etc.) between HPV-positive and negative OCSCC patients after 3 months posttreatment but nearly all parameters showed more average percentage change in HPV-positive cases. Some patients were missing QOL data in the report by Sharma et al. at certain time points, which could be biasing the results, and the majority of the study population was white. Therefore, the results may not be representative of more diverse populations of HNC patients especially in India. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time reports a comparison between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases in terms of quality of life to various modalities in Indian population.
