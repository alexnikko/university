Introduction
For over half a century, clinician investigators have devised tests to evaluate cutaneous sympathetic innervation. Various subjective tests were developed as a component of bedside autonomic evaluation to assess the level of sudomotor activity, much as a pin is used to test the level of analgesia. These subjective tests include examination with the unaided eye, visualization with light reflection, magnification with an ophthalmoscope, palpation of the patient’s skin for slickness, and gliding the back of a spoon over the patient’s skin to detect moisture-induced friction [ , ].
The thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) was introduced for objective evaluation of sudomotor function [ ]. Subsequently several other tests were devised for objective evaluation of sweating, including the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, silicone impressions test, sympathetic skin response, and quantitative direct and indirect axon reflex test [ ]. The TST is considered to be the gold standard for the qualitative, objective assessment of the entire anterior body surface, and the other tests assess localized sudomotor activity. However, all of these tests involve specialized equipment and are expensive and time-consuming. For the patient, the TST is uncomfortable and requires disrobing and having the whole body covered with the color indicator. It would be useful to screen patients with a convenient and valid bedside test to justify the need for the TST.
Several tests for bedside assessment of sweating are available but have not been validated. The aim of the study reported here was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of five subjective bedside tests of sudomotor function with the objective TST in a controlled prospective study.
Methods
Patients
Patients referred to the senior author (RKK) for autonomic disorders were evaluated with comprehensive history, detailed somatic and autonomic neurologic examination, and a standard battery of autonomic tests: heart rate response to deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and head-up tilt [ ]. The TST, a component of the battery of antonomic tests, was conducted after bedside tests for the assessment of sweating had been performed. For the TST, 5 days before the test the patients stopped taking any medications that inhibit or promote sweating [ ].
All participants signed a consent form indicating their understanding that their test results and de-identified photographs could be used for research purposes.
Each patient was assessed prospectively by the RKK using all five bedside tests. The response to each test at the various sites was recorded as present (+) or absent (−) in a tabulated form. RKK then administered the TST to each patient and recorded the sweat distribution pattern on an anatomic drawing. The data were accumulated on 205 consecutive patients over 5 years without any interim review and were collated by the second author (CR).
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for retrospective review of prospectively collected data. We included 146 patients in the study based on TST results, of whom 130 showed normal sweating and 16 had anhidrosis. To optimize conditions for specificity of the tests, anhidrosis was defined as complete anhidrosis except for rare localized purple dots unrelated to the selected body sites. Fifty-nine patients with other patterns of anhidrosis were excluded.
Testing sites
Selection of loci for subjective assessment of sudomotor activity was based on the regional distribution of sweating. The forehead, neck, anterior surface of the trunk, dorsal region of the hands, and adjacent parts of the forearm usually sweat the most. Legs contribute more to sweating than thighs [ ]. Therefore, the seven bilaterally symmetrical representative sites selected were the forehead, neck, chest, forearm, hand dorsum, proximal leg, and foot dorsum. Each site was examined using five subjective bedside methods.
Techniques for bedside tests
For each bedside test, unclothed patients sat in a sauna room in conditions mimicking the bedside setting of 80 °F (26.7 °C) and 35% humidity for 10–15 min for acclimation. For observation with the unaided eye, the examiner looked for the presence of sweat droplets on the patient’s skin. For observation via light reflection, the examiner shone a bright pen light onto the patient’s skin at an angle and perpendicular to the skin surface. The sweat droplets reflecting the light were visualized [ ]. The detection of light reflection was marked as a positive finding for the presence of sweat at that site. The examiner avoided use of a low-intensity penlight or a very bright light close to the skin surface to help prevent artifacts.
Magnification with an ophthalmoscope involved the use of a bright light, 20+ lens, and a large round aperture used for general examination of the eye. The examiner held the ophthalmoscope at an angle and slowly varied magnification and the distance from the skin to focus on the sweat droplets. Subdued ambient lighting was used to optimize the observation of sweat [ ]. Light reflection from sweat droplets was marked as a positive finding for presence of sweat. High sebum content of the forehead mimicked sweating by reflecting light and producing a silvery appearance under magnification. However, oily secretions could be felt by the examiner’s fingertips and wiped [ ].
Palpation of the patients’ skin was done with the tips of the index and middle fingers. Moisture on the skin caused the palpating dry fingers to feel a “pull.” If the examiner had moist fingers, the dry dorsum of these fingers was used to brush against the patient’s skin to detect moisture.
The spoon test involved use of a simple kitchen soup spoon and an alcohol swab for sterilization of the spoon (Fig. 1 ). The clean, dry spoon was held between the thumb and forefinger and its convex surface was gently drawn along the skin surface, with the weight of the spoon providing the only source of pressure [ , ]. With this simple motion, the spoon glided smoothly across the skin at all times and at all sites unless it met moist skin, where friction caused the spoon to stop. Wherever the spoon stuck to the moist skin it was quickly dried and reapplied at the next site. To reduce the chance of a false sense of friction, the spoon was drawn parallel with skin folds and not against loose folds of skin at the neck and other sites. Any external pressure on the spoon was avoided so as not to increase the contact area and create a false sense of friction [ , ]. The neck was kept hyperextended during the procedure to maximize smoothness of the skin. Patients were advised to avoid frowning, which causes skin folds and pseudofriction at the forehead.

TST technique
The TST was employed for the objective assessment of sweating. The disrobed patient rested in supine position in the sauna room and the body surface was “painted” with commercially available iodine. The iodine was allowed to dry, and cornstarch was sprinkled over the dried iodine as a color indicator for sweating. One temperature probe was placed in the oral cavity between the cheek and lower gum and another was applied to the skin over the right suprascapular region to monitor temperatures. After baseline temperatures were recorded, the room temperature was raised by a heater to 110–120 °F (43.3–48.9 °C) while the humidity was maintained at 35–40%. The skin was heated by an overhead infrared lamp. Oral and skin temperatures were continuously monitored, and the patient was observed through a window. As the patient sweated, the cornstarch changed from a pale-yellow to a dark-purple color, making the distribution of sweat easy to visualize. The test was continued until the patient’s oral temperature increased by 1.8 °F (1 °C) over baseline to at least 100.4 °F (38 °C) or when the patient demonstrated generalized sweating. Upon termination of the test, the room temperature was lowered using a commercial exhaust fan. The patient’s sweat distribution was marked on an anatomic drawing and photographed [ , ].
Statistical analysis
Results of each bedside test were compared with the results of the TST. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Sensitivity evaluated how effective the test was for detecting the presence of sweating. Specificity evaluated the effectiveness of the test for identifying the absence of sweating. SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to perform the analysis.
Results
Based on the results of the TST, patients with normal (symmetrical and generalized) sweating and anhidrotic patients were selected for the study. Of the 146 patients, 130 displayed generalized sweating (27 men, 103 women; age range 16–62 years, mean age 36 years). Postural tachycardia syndrome (58) and syncope (17) were the most common diagnoses. Chronic orthostatic intolerance, Parkinson’s disease, endocrinopathies, and suspected autonomic neuropathies constituted the diagnoses for the remainder of the patients. The anhidrosis group included 16 patients (5 men, 11 women; age range 50–83 years, mean age 60.4 years). Clinical diagnoses in this group were multiple-system atrophy (5 patients), “pure autonomic failure” (3 patients), autonomic neuropathies (6 patients), and chronic idiopathic anhidrosis (2 patients).
Sensitivity of the bedside tests varied by body site and by the subjective method (Table 1 ). By site, bedside tests were more sensitive in detecting sweating over the forehead, neck, upper chest, and dorsum of the hands. Forearms and legs were the least amenable to sweat detection by bedside methods. At the forehead, ophthalmoscopic magnification (18%) and the spoon test (51%) displayed higher sensitivity than the other methods. At the neck, the spoon test and palpation method were more sensitive than other methods in detecting sweating. By method, the sensitivity of sweat detection by unaided eye was the lowest, varying from 0% at the leg to 5% at the forehead. The spoon test had the highest sensitivity at all 14 sites, varying from 4% at the forearms and legs to about 86% at the neck. When results of the two most sensitive tests, the spoon test and magnification, were combined, sensitivity did not increase compared with the spoon test alone (combined sensitivity of approximately 52% at the forehead, 86% at the neck, and 58% at the chest).

With the exception of the spoon test, all bedside tests exhibited 100% specificity in that they showed no positive results for any patients at any site (Table 1 ). The spoon test was falsely positive in almost 50% (9/16 right neck, 7/16 left neck) of anhidrotic patients at the neck and in 19% (3/16 patients) of these patients at the chest.
Discussion
Sweating is a neurocutaneous thermoregulatory function. The efferent limb of the sweating reflex consists of the hypothalamus, the preganglionic neurons of the intermediolateral spinal column, and the postganglionic neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. Structural lesions of the central or peripheral sudomotor neural pathways can produce hyperhidrosis or anhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis can be easily assessed by unaided eye, but a normal amount of sweating may be difficult to detect.
The TST is an established test for the assessment of cutaneous sympathetic innervation. TST provides a visual display of the distribution of sweating but does not identify the amount of sweating. The test requires a custom-designed space with special electrical, plumbing, and exhaust systems to provide standard conditions of temperature and humidity and a control desk outside the sweat chamber. Additional equipment includes a digital camera for a photographic record and a computerized system for continuous monitoring of heat, humidity, and oral and cutaneous temperatures. The test is time-consuming and cumbersome. Patients may complain of claustrophobia or heat intolerance. Patients also require facilities where they can clean up after the test. Because of these limitations, it would be useful to have a valid bedside screening test to reduce the need for the TST.
As expected, the bedside tests fell short of the TST in their power to accurately detect the presence or absence of sweating. Except for the spoon test, the bedside tests had very low sensitivity and were therefore an ineffective screening tool. The specificity of such a test may be high, as in this study, but high specificity does not have any screening value in the setting of very low sensitivity. Relatively high sensitivity of the spoon test at the forehead, neck, and chest suggests that this test is a useful screening tool at these sites. Lower sensitivity was found at other body sites. Specificity of the spoon test was low at the neck (approximately 50%) in that the test detected sweating in anhidrotic patients at this site. This finding represents a weakness of the spoon test for detecting anhidrosis at the neck. Refinements of the spoon test technique and its reproducibility by other investigators may improve its usefulness.
We found that the spoon test was a useful screening tool for the assessment of sweating over the chest and forehead. Because it is highly sensitive and specific for the forehead site, it may be particularly useful in evaluating facial sweating in patients with Horner’s syndrome [ ]. The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) is also a validated test of postganglionic sudomotor function with commercially available equipment [ ]. It is performed in the distal aspects of the limbs to detect sudomotor abnormalities. The spoon test may be of supplemental value with this test in assessing sudomotor activity at proximal sites. Furthermore, the spoon test may facilitate detection of sweating during TST in the occasional patient with history of allergy to the color indicator for sweating.
The TST remains the most accurate method to assess distribution of sweating, but it requires extraordinary time and resources and involves potential discomfort to patients. Based on findings of this study, the spoon test is substantially more effective than other bedside tests in assessing sweating in the chest, neck, and forehead. The spoon test is quick, inexpensive, and easy to perform, and it does not require special skills [ ]. The data from our study suggest that the spoon test is expedient for clinical bedside assessment of sudomotor activity at the chest, neck, and forehead.
