INTRODUCTION
Morin hydrate or Morin is a yellow crystalline polyphenolic flavonoid that has been identified in a number of plants, e.g. , guava ( Psidium guajava ) leaves ( ), white mulberry, onion, apple, and in several beverages such as tea and coffee ( ). Morin was reported to inhibit lipid peroxidation and has antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory ( ), and cardiovascular protection activities ( ). Medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) is an efficient preparative column chromatography technique. MPLC can provide fast and large quantities compounds separations while HPLC is used to check the purity of the isolated compounds. The biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) is one of the most significant tools created to facilitate oral drug products development. Class I and III drugs can be formulated and designed with a simple strategy, while class II and IV drugs are formulated depending on their biopharmaceutical and physicochemical properties ( ). Morin is BCS class IV drug ( ); being a class IV drug is a challenge for the formulator to improve its solubility and bioavailability.
Drug delivery system has arisen to minimize side effects, solve absorption problems (especially class II and IV drugs), expand modes of administration, and broaden application of drugs. The oral route of administration represents 80% of pharmaceutical products and is considered the most attractive candidates for improving substance solubility in the form of emulsified carriers. For this reason, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery (SNEDD) and nanoemulsion (NE) have received particular attention with droplet sizes less than 200 nm ( ) resulting in enhanced oral bioavailability of drugs. The primary consideration in excipients selection lies in identifying the excipients that will solubilize the entire drug dose in acceptable volume. The chosen surfactant must lower the interfacial tension while achieving a high solubilization power to aid the dispersion during preparation. Cremophore® RH40, possess a high hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) value, and is used as surfactant because of its non-ionic nature, with better emulsification effect and absorption enhancement ( ). The surfactant concentration (30–60% ( w / w )) was reported to produce a stable systems ( ).
The present study aimed to demonstrate a preparative MPLC method for the isolation of Morin and to determine the enhanced efficacy of the optimized SNEDD and NE systems of Morin compared to Morin by investigating their lung protective effect against the in - vivo HgCl 2 -induced lung toxicity in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Psidium guajava Linn. (Myrtaceae) leaves were purchased from local herbalist, Egypt. The plant identity was kindly confirmed by Prof. Abd El-halem A. El-Meged (Agriculture Research Center, Cairo, Egypt). Morin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Germany); Capryol™ 90, Plurol oleique® (Gattefosse, France); Olive, Jojoba and Almond oil (analytical grade); Tween, Propylene glycol, Polyethylene glycol 400 (Merck-schuchardt, Germany); Cremophor® RH40 & Cremophor® EL (BASF, Germany); Adult rats (160 ± 12 g) were obtained from Faculty of Veterinary medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, and were housed individually in air-conditioned room at 22 ± 1°C, RH (60%), and an 8:00 to 20:00 light cycle.
MPLC and HPLC Specifications
Morin isolation was done using Sepacore® X10 flash chromatography systems with flash cartridges (4 × 22 cm, 120 g silica RP-18 column; Switzerland). The pump C-601 was functioned at 10–15 psi pressure, and the column preconditioned with methanol/water (50:50) for 30 min at 40 mL/min. Separation process can be followed automatically with a UV spectrophotometer detector C-640 followed by automatic fraction collector C-660. Column chromatography was carried out on Sephadex LH-20 (50–800 mm) (Sigma Aldrich Co., Germany) using 100% methanol. Fractions were observed by thin layer chromatography on precoated silica gel 60 F 254 (0.25 mm) (MerckR, Darmstadt, Germany). The purity was studied on analytical HPLC Shimadzu (LC-20AT series) equipped with degasser, quaternary pump, auto injector (10 μL), and multiple wavelength detector (SPD-20 AD Model) at 280 nm, and the retention time ( R t) was determined (Shimadzu, Japan). Prontosil ODS C 18 (5 μm, 15 cm × 4.5 mm I.D.) column was used as stationary phase. Stock solution of Morin 1 mg/mL was made by solubilizing 20 mg standard Morin in 20 mL methanol. 1 H NMR was measured on Bruker 400 MHz AC NMR spectrometer. Morin was dissolved in deuterated methanol DeuteroR (Kastellaun, Germany).
HPLC Validation
The method was carefully validated according to ICH guidelines ( ). To determine the robustness of the developed method, experimental conditions were deliberately altered. The robustness of the method was assessed at two different concentrations (50 and 75 μg/mL) for Morin. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL/min. To study the effect of flow rate on the resolution, flow was changed by 0.1 units from 0.3 to 0.6 mL/min, also column with the same specifications from different supplier Zorbax ODS C18 (5 μm, 15 cm × 4.5 mm I.D.) was used to study the effect of column. The effect of the percent organic strength on resolution was studied by varying methanol by (± 2%) and held other mobile phase component as stated in the chromatographic conditions section.
Isolation and Purification of Morin
A hydroalcoholic (70%) extract was prepared by macerated 500 g powder of dried Psidium guajava leaves with (70%) ethanol. Ethanol was filtered and evaporated by rotary evaporator (Sineco Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) under reduced pressure yielding hydroalcoholic extract (55 g, 11%). Subsequently, hydroalcoholic extract (45 g) was suspended in 400 mL distilled water and sonicated for 30 min. Solvent-solvent extraction was used to fractionate the extract using dichloromethane (5 × 1 L) then ethyl acetate (5 × 1 L). The ethyl acetate fraction was dried under reduced pressure (2.4 g). To determine the suitable elution system for separation, a part of ethyl acetate fraction (100 mg) was dissolved in methanol and loaded onto the loop of MPLC. The samples were eluted with a series of methanol/water (65:35, 55:45, 50:50, and 45:55 v / v ), and methanol/acetonitrile/water (35:25:40 v / v ) solvent systems. Among the various solvent systems tried, methanol/water (65:35) at a flow rate of 40 mL/min provided the optimum separation. Therefore, the final separation was accomplished as provided by the optimum separation manner. The fractions containing Morin detected as single spot on TLC, pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure. Morin fraction was purified on sephadex LH20 (5 × 80 cm, 100 g) using methanol as eluent. A pale yellow powder of Morin were isolated which was further characterized using 1D NMR spectroscopy compared to published data.
Isolated Morin (10 mg) was accurately dissolved into methanol (10 mL) to prepare 1 mg/mL stock solution. Serial dilutions (50, 75 μg/mL) were done. Morin concentrations of diluted samples were determine using analytical reversed-phase HPLC using methanol/water (45:55) as mobile phase and 0.5 mL/min flow rate. The recovery percent was calculated using Beer’s lambert law.
Preformulation Studies
Saturated Solubility of Morin in Various Oils
To find out the appropriate oil phase, the solubility of Morin in various oils namely Capryol™ 90, olive oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil was determined. In a stoppered vial, an excess amount of Morin was added to each oil, vortexed for 5 min, then shaken at (25 ± 0.5°C) for 72 h to get equilibrium ( ), and then centrifuged for 30 min at 2500 rpm to remove undissolved Morin, followed by supernatant filtration through Millipore 0.45 μm. The drug concentration in each filtrate was determined at λ max = 265 nm in ethanol using UV/VIS spectrophotometer (UV-1601 PC, Shimadzu, Japan).
Screening of the Percent of Water Incorporated of the Selected Oil with Different Surfactants, Cosurfactants, and Surfactant/Cosurfactant Mixture Ratios
Screening of surfactants with the selected oil from the saturated solubility was carried out, followed by screening of the selected surfactant with different cosurfactants then screening the selected surfactant/cosurfactant (S/CoS) mixture at different ratios (1:0, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 w / w ) with the same selected oil. Four surfactants (Cremophor® RH40, Cremophor® EL, Tween 80, and Tween 20) were screened with the selected oil ( ). Oil and surfactant were mixed together at fixed ratio (1:1 w / w ), then water was added drop-wise and during titration the samples were stirred magnetically to reach equilibrium. The affinity of samples to form a transparent emulsion was detected visually ( ). The maximum amount of water incorporated into the mixture served as one of the standards in the final selection of system development. Percentage water incorporated was calculated as follows: $$ \mathrm{Percentage}\ \mathrm{water}\ \mathrm{incorporated}\ \left(\%\right)=\frac{\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{water}\ \mathrm{added}}{\left(\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{mixture}+\mathrm{weight}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{water}\ \mathrm{added}\right)}\kern0.5em \mathrm{x}\ 100 $$ (1)
To the selected oil and surfactant, screenings of CoS (propylene glycol, polyethylene glychol 400, and plurol oleique) were done in order to present the most suitable oil, surfactant, and CoS. Screening of the suitable S/CoS mixture at different ratios was also carried out (ratios 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 w / w ). Mixtures were screened against the selected oil on the basis of their ability to produce a one-phase system with water. The method used was developed by Djekic and Primorac ( ) in order to determine the type and minimal concentration and ratio of S/CoS blend that have good solubilizing capacity for the oil.
Construction of Phase Diagram
Phase diagram was made to determine the percentage of components that can produce the maximum nanoemulsion area ( ). The selected component comprise of Capryol™ 90 together with Cremophore® RH40 and water which were mixed to construct the phase diagram. Phase diagram was constructed by weighing appropriate amounts of each component into small vials, mixed by vortex (MS-300HS, Korea) for 10 min and gently stirring with heating at 37°C to get a homogenous mixture. Thirty-six systems were prepared and stored under ambient conditions for 24 h before visual examination ( ).
Preparation of Morin Formulae
Based on trials and phase diagram construction, various formulations were prepared for the SNEDDs and NEs (Table I ) using various concentrations of surfactant (40, 50, and 60% w / w ) and different oil concentrations (20, 40, 50, and 60% w / w ). In order to prepare Morin-loaded formulae: oil and S weight ratio was weighed in glass containers, followed by adding (0.2% w / w ) of Morin then water which was gently vortexed for 15 min, the resultant formulae were stored for 72 h at room temperature till equilibrium.

Morin Formulae Evaluation Tests
Visual Inspection
The prepared Morin formulae were examined for transparency, fluidity, consistency, and syneresis by visual observation against light.
Thermodynamic Stability
To assess the thermodynamic stability, three tests were done ( ): Centrifuge stress examination: Each formula was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 35 min and then examined for phase separation and liquefaction. Formulae that did not show separation were considered for cooling-heating cycle. Cooling-heating cycle: Each formula was acquiesced to a three complete cycles, each cycle consists of 24 h at 5°C followed by 24 h at 45°C. Formulae which were stable were considered for freeze thaw stress test. Freeze thaw stress test: Each formula was submitted to a three complete cycles which were important for determining the ability of each formula to withstand thermal shock, as well as to evaluate physical stability, each cycle consists of 24 h at 25°C followed by 24 h at − 5°C.
Drug Content
The prepared Morin formula (0.1 g) was dissolved in a 100 mL flask containing ethanol. This solution was left for 15 min under continuous stirring. The concentration of Morin in each solution was measured by UV spectrophotometer at the predetermined λ max = 265 nm to calculate the percentage of drug content in each formula.
Rheological Properties Measurements
Morin formulae viscosities were determined by Brookfield Digital Rheometer DV III ultra-fitted with CP-40 cone and plate spindle (USA). A 0.5 mL of each formula was placed on the plate of the apparatus and the rpm was increased regularly with 30 s between each two successive speeds to provide torque values between 10 and 70 units, at (25 ± 2°C). The shear stress was plotted versus the shear rate values, and viscosity values were determined ( ).
Robustness to Dilution and Phase Separation
As a trial to simulate physiological dilution after oral administration, F1 SNEDD, F2 SNEDD, and F3 SNEDD were diluted 50, 100, and 1000 times with different aqueous media including water, 0.1 N HCl, and pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. The mixture formed was left for 2 h, followed by examination visually to inspect clarity and homogeneity. The formula which did not show separation or precipitation at the end of the 2 h period was used in the following test ( ).
Emulsification Time Measurement
The rate of emulsification of the prepared Morin SNEDDs is a vital index for the measurement of the efficacy of emulsification. This was carried out in 500 mL of 0.1 N HCl at (37 ± 0.5°C) using a USP II dissolution apparatus (Pharma Test, Type PTW, Germany), and agitation was delivered by a dissolution paddle operated at 100 rpm then a glass slide containing a 0.5 g formula was introduced into the dissolution media. The performance was evaluated visually by means of grading system (A, B, C, and D) ( ). Type A and B systems are most likely expected to have globule size in the nanometer range which is classified as SNEDDs ( ). Turbidity measurement is required to identify the efficiency of the self-emulsification and whether the dispersion has reached equilibrium or not ( ); this was further confirmed by the measurement of transmittance %, that was measured spectrophotometrically at 638 nm using 0.1 N HCl as a blank ( ).
Particle Size Analysis and Zeta Potential Measurement (ζ)
The measurement was performed by Malvern Zetasizer (ver.6.20 serial number: MAL 104 4595, Malvern, UK). Exactly 0.1 mL of each prepared formula was diluted with 10 mL distilled water and shake to faint opalescence before analysis. The poly dispersity index (PDI) or span gives a sign for the homogeneity of each formula ( ). In the case of ζ , the instrument measures the electrophoretic mobility and surface charge ( ).
In-vitro Dissolution Studies
Each 500 mg system, containing 1 mg Morin, was filled into hard gelatin capsule size 00 ( ). No leakage was observed from all capsules filled with the different prepared Morin formulae. Dissolution studies of Morin from capsules were carried out using the USP dissolution tester, rotating paddle at 50 rpm over a period of 60 min. Studies were done at 37 ± 0.5°C in 300 mL of 0.1 N HCl. Each capsule was located at the base of the apparatus using a sinker. At appropriate time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 min), sample (2 mL) was taken and filtered by a 0.2 μm filter membrane and analyzed for Morin concentration at the predetermined λ max = 277.6 nm against 0.1 N HCl. After 10 min ( Q 10 min ), all the dissolution data from the different prepared formulae were compared to free Morin capsule (1 mg). All comparisons were done using one-way (ANOVA) to study the effect of surfactant and oil concentration.
Determination of Surface Morphology by Transmission Electron Microscopy
The selected Morin formulae according to smallest size, highest zeta potential, and release at Q 10 min were examined for their morphology (F3 SNEDD and F6 NE). One drop of diluted sample was deposited on a film-coated 200-mesh copper grid, stained with one drop of (2%) aqueous solution of phosphotungstic acid, and allowed to dry then examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-1230, Japan) ( ).
In-vivo Assessment of the Protective Potential of Morin and Its Selected Formulae Against HgCl2-Induced Lung Toxicity in Rats
Experimental Setup of the In-vivo Study
This experiment was done according to guidelines established by the Animal Care and use Committee of October 6 University, Giza, Egypt. Ethical clearance was taken according to the institutional animal experimentation committee at October 6 University before the study. Groups of animals (eight rats each) were treated as follows: group I (normal), rats were given saline orally for 28 days; group II (positive control), rats were treated with HgCl 2 (1 mg/kg); group III, rats were treated with Morin (20 mg/kg) + HgCl 2 (1 mg/kg); group IV, rats were treated with F3 SNEDD (20 mg/kg) + HgCl 2 (1 mg/kg); group V, rats were treated with F6 NE (20 mg/kg) + HgCl 2 (1 mg/kg). All treatments were suspended in saline and taken daily for 28 days. On the 30 th day, fasting blood samples were taken from the retro orbital plexus under anesthesia using diethyl ether. Blood was collected in citrated clean tubes, centrifuged, and plasma was used freshly for estimation of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), hydroperoxide (HP), immunoglobulin E (IgE), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and haptoglobin which were done using commercially kits (Asan and Youngdong Pharmaceutical Co., Korea) ( , , , , , , , ). Histamine was also determined (Ridascreen® ELISA kit R- Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany).
After blood collection, all animals were killed and lung tissues were dissected and homogenized in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1700 rpm in 4°C. The supernatant (20%) was used for quantitative determination of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by ELISA ( ). Lung nitrate concentration was determined by the Griess reaction after quantitative conversion of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase ( ). Lipid peroxidation in lung homogenate was determined by spectrophotometer method ( ). The level of lipid peroxides was expressed as nmol malonaldehyde/mg protein. Activity of caspase-3 was determined using a colorimetric caspase-3 assay kit (cat. no. ab39401) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The assays were performed in 96-well plates by incubating 20 μL cell lysate protein/sample in 70 μL reaction buffer (1% NP-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mM NAD, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 μL caspase-3 substrate (2 mM). Lysates were then incubated at 37°C for 6 h, after which the samples were assayed using a spectrophotometer (cat. no. 1702525; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 405 nm ( ). The glutathione peroxidase assay kit measures GPx activity indirectly by a coupled reaction with GR ( ). The specific activities of the various enzymes in the blood are expressed in U/g of the hemoglobin content determined as stated above. Lung-reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase levels were estimated ( , ).
The Determination of Lung IL-6 Gene
Expressions of mRNAs for the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 were quantified by semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues (approximately 30 mg) using the RNAEasy kit (QIAGEN, Germany), according to the manufacturer protocol. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene ( ). The primer sequences were given in Table II . Table II Sequence of the IL-6 Primers for Real-Time PCR Usage Sequence of primer bP IL-6 Forward: 5′-TGA TGG ATG CTT CCA AAC TG-3′ Reverse: 5′-GAG CAT TGG AAG TTG GGG TA-3′ 20 20 GAPDH F: 5′-ATGAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCAT-3′ R: 5′-CCAGCCGAGCCACATCGCTC-3′ 20 22
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as (mean ± SD). All analyses utilized SPSS 13.0 statistical package for Windows (SPSS, 13.0 software, Inc., Chicago, IL, 2003) ( ). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done for comparisons of means of the different groups. A p value (< 0.05) was considered as statistically significant with LSD test as the post-hoc test.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Phytochemical Study and HPLC Validation
MPLC allows faster purification of huge compounds quantities with improved separations than open column chromatography. The purity of compound was done using analytical reversed-phase HPLC, where recovery percent was 90% with retention time ( Rt 2.46 min). Identification of Morin was achieved by comparing their spectral data with that published ( ).
Linearity and Sensitivity
Calibration curve was constructed by application of the method to different Morin concentrations giving linear Beer’s plot between the concentration against peak area at the selected retention time with concentration range from 5 to 100 μg/mL with an intercept (116,445), slope (40,367), and good correlation coefficient (0.9996).
Accuracy
Beer’s lambert law was applied for determination of blind concentrations (25, 50, and 75 μg/mL) of Morin within the linearity range with mean recovery percent of 99.34 ± 1.25%.
Precision
Three concentrations of Morin (25, 50, and 75 μg/mL) were analyzed three times within the day with a relative standard deviation of 1.65 while the intermediate precision was determined by analyzing the same concentration in three consecutive days with RSD of 1.43.
Robustness
The robustness of the developed method as relative standard deviation (RSD) of the average concentration determinations after deliberate conditions change was 1.87.
Preformulation Studies
Saturated Solubility of Morin in Various Oils
Oil represents one of the most important excipients in the formulation; Capryol™ 90 showed a significant ( p < 0.001) increase in Morin solubility (6.468 ± 0.215 mg/mL); this might be attributed to its surfactant properties when compared to the other oils (Table III ). Table III Saturated Solubility of Morin in Different Oils Followed by Screening of the Percent of Water Incorporated of the Selected Oil with Different Surfactants, Cosurfactants, and S/CoS Mixture Ratios Oil Maximum solubility (mg/mL) ± SD, n = 3 Capryol™ 90 6.468 ± 0.415 Olive 3.058 ± 0.198 Almond 2.764 ± 0.245 Jojoba 0.244 ± 0.043 Surfactant Percentage water incorporated (%) ± SD, n = 3 Cremophore® RH40 14.821 ± 0.045 Cremophore® EL 10.233 ± 0.220 Tween 80 12.126 ± 0.509 Tween 20 11.582 ± 1.050 Cosurfactant Percentage water incorporated (%) ± SD, n = 3 Propylene glycol 11.675 ± 0.112 Polyethylene glychol 400 7.386 ± 0.600 Plurol oleique 7.337 ± 0.509 S/CoS ratio (Crem./PG) Percentage water incorporated (%) ± SD, n = 3 Ratio 1:0 14.529 ± 0.212 Ratio 1:1 12.663 ± 0.450 Ratio 2:1 11.347 ± 0.220 Ratio 3:1 12.967 ± 0.119
Screening of the Percent of Water Incorporated of Capryol™ 90 with Different Surfactants, Cosurfactants, and S/CoS Mixture Ratios
Cremophore® RH40 showed the highest percentage of water incorporated (14.821 ± 0.45%). The highest percentage of water incorporated in the case of cosurfactants was found to be propylene glycol (11.675 ± 0.112%). In the case of S/CoS ratio (Crem./PG) study, the ratio 1:0 showed a remarkable ( p < 0.001) increase in percentage water incorporated (14.529 ± 0.2125%) (Table III ).
Construction of Phase Diagram
Phase diagram construction aims to find the clear region and domains for NE; the phase diagram was constructed by Capryol™ 90 as oil and Cremophore® RH40 as surfactant beside water. The dark spots in the phase diagram represent the transparent region while the rest region represents the turbid areas (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Ternary phase diagram of Morin nanoemulsion system enclosing Capryol™ 90 and Cremophore® RH40
Evaluation Tests of the Different Prepared Morin Formulae
Visual Inspection
All Morin formulae showed a clear yellowish appearance attributed to inheritant color of Morin.
Thermodynamic Stability
All the prepared Morin formulae (NEs and SNEDDs) showed no syneresis, no phase separation, and no changes in physical appearance, which indicate their good physical stability and confers long shelf life when compared to ordinary emulsions ( ).
Drug Content
The percentage of Morin in NEs and SNEDDs prepared formulae varied from 97.83 ± 0.55 to 101.00 ± 0.25%.
Rheological Properties Measurement
Assessment of the rheological behavior of Morin formulae is vital in determining its ability to be filled in hard or soft gelatin capsules; it revealed that all the tested formulae exhibited Newtonian flow. The formulae showed viscosity values 73.03 ± 2.8, 110.15 ± 2.45, and 147.68 ± 1.25 cP respectively for F1 SNEDD, F2 SNEDD, and F3 SNEDD. Upon increasing the percentage of Capryol 90™, the viscosity became lowered; this might be attributed to the low viscosity value of Capryol™ 90 which is reported to be close to zero ( ). Regarding the effect of surfactant concentration on rheological values, it was noticed that upon increasing the surfactant concentration, an increase in the viscosity values were observed. For Morin NE formulae, a remarked ( p < 0.001) increase over SNEDDs was observed as follows 238.60 ± 22.15, 311.21 ± 14.07, and 342.19 ± 24.72 cP for F4 NE, F5 NE, and F6 NE respectively; this might be attributed to the increased surfactant concentration in addition to water. It was reported that the viscosity values less than 10,000 cP could be filled in hard gelatin capsules by commercial liquid filling equipment ( ).
Robustness to Dilution and Phase Separation Study
The different fold of dilution in various media was used as an attempt to mimic the in - vivo conditions ( ). Visual inspection of the formed solutions showed nanoemulsions with clear (F2 SNEDD and F3 SNEDD) to slight bluish appearance (F1 SNEDD). Due to the considerable clarity of the resultant emulsions of diluted formulae, the prepared systems could be termed self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems. It was noticed that increasing surfactant concentration caused increase in the degree of clarity of the formed nanoemulsions. None of the prepared formulae showed any change at the end of the 2-h period. Percent transmittance was found to be 98.982, 99.360, and 99.020% for F1 SNEDD, F2 SNEDD, and F3 SNEDD respectively. It is clear from results that all of them possess a grade (A) systems which exhibit high percentage transmittance above 98%. It has been reported that transmittance above 90% indicates good emulsification ability with size in nanometer range ( ); none of the prepared systems showed any change within the 12-h storage period after dilution.
Emulsification Time Measurement
Assessment of self-emulsification time do not only indicate the time needed for the emulsification process under gentle agitation but also ensures the dispersion of Morin within the dispersed emulsion without further precipitation. Time needed for detecting 90% Morin in distilled water was chosen as the time required for emulsification. Generally, upon increasing the surfactant concentration, the time of emulsification increased (78 ± 6, 97 ± 4, and 134 ± 10 s for F1, F2, and F3 SNEDD respectively). These findings could be related to the high surfactant concentration that possesses the most viscous system; it forms gel upon contact with water, and this effect could be responsible for the delayed dispersion. While systems with low surfactant concentration did not form gels and therefore caused immediate dispersion ( ).
Particle Size Analysis and Zeta Potential Measurement
Morin formulae showed a small size with less than 40 nm. The mean particle size was as follows 34.61 ± 8.42, 19.57 ± 5.99, and 18.57 ± 4.34 nm for F1 SNEDD, F2 SNEDD, and F3 SNEDD while 20.13 ± 4.22, 18.57 ± 4.34, and 16.42 ± 4.48 nm for F4 NE, F5 NE, and F6 NE respectively. It was observed that upon increasing the surfactant concentration, the particle size decreased and upon increasing the oil concentration the particle size increased. It was reported that upon increasing the emulsifier amount a gradual decrease in size was observed ( ). The PDI was found to be from 0.22 to 0.49; these values indicate higher uniformity between the particles ( ) . Results ranged from − 10.36 ± 0.99 to − 20.50 ± 5.60 mV as shown in Table IV . Zeta potential allows the prediction of good colloidal stability due to the high-energy barrier between particles. The absolute zeta potential values greater than |8–9 mV| are a prerequisite for the systems stability ( ). Table IV Mean Size, Span, and Zeta Potential (ζ) Formula code Mean size “nm” (± S.D) Span (PDI) Zeta potential (± S.D) F1 SNEDD 34.61 ± 8.42 0.225 − 10.36 ± 0.99 F2 SNEDD 19.57 ± 5.99 0.236 − 16.10 ± 4.65 F3 SNEDD 18.57 ± 4.34 0.225 − 18.52 ± 1.23 F4 NE 20.13 ± 4.22 0.490 − 12.00 ± 0.59 F5 NE 18.57 ± 4.34 0.301 − 17.36 ± 1.00 F6 NE 16.42 ± 4.48 0.302 − 20.50 ± 5.60
In-vitro Dissolution Studies
The surfactant and oil concentration effect on the percentage Morin dissolved after 10 min ( Q 10 min ) from the different filled capsules were studied as illustrated graphically in Figs. 2 and 3 . It is obvious that the extent of free Morin dissolved from the capsule showed significantly ( p < 0.001) the lowest percent dissolved only 22.21 ± 1.45% after 10 min, while the percent of Morin dissolved from SNEDDs and NEs was significantly ( p < 0.001) higher, more than 55% dissolved. In SNEDD formulae, increasing oil concentration from 40 to 60% significantly ( p < 0.001) lowered dissolution; this retardation in dissolution might be due to Morin affinity to vehicle ( ), and retention in the oil droplets. The above results are in agreement with the particle size measurement; it was observed that increasing the oil concentration caused increased particle size. In case of NE formulae, the oil concentration was constant; it was found that upon increasing the concentration of surfactant an improved drug dissolution was observed, this might be attributed to the presence of the drug in a solubilized form and upon exposure to dissolution medium, small droplets were formed leading to rapid drug dissolution. It is well known that the behavior of drug dissolution is due to the size which is inversely proportional to the surface area thus the higher the drug dissolution ( ).

Determination of Surface Morphology by TEM
Morin formulae according to the smallest particle size and highest zeta potential and release at Q 10 min were carried out (F3 SNEDD and F6 NE). The droplet size of the chosen freshly prepared Morin formulae were found to be 20.5 ± 3.2 nm for F3 SNEDD and 12.9 ± 5.0 nm for F6 NE. Photographs of TEM showed that all droplets after dilution had nearly uniform spherical shape as shown in Fig. 4 .

Mercury has been found to promote atherosclerosis ( ). The present study demonstrates that HgCl 2 induced obvious elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides. Moreover, HDL-C level decreased obviously in HgCl 2 -treated group. The increased level of cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased HDL-C in HgCl 2 -treated group reflected the abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism which might result in high level of cholesterol and development of atherosclerosis. In our study, cholesterol, triglycerides of Morin, and its formulae-treated groups showed an obvious reduction with an increase in HDL-C concentration as compared with HgCl 2 -treated group. The hypocholesterolemic effect of Morin in rabbits fed on diet enriched with cholesterol has also been reported ( ). It was observed that Morin decreased plasma cholesterol level and increased HDL-C suggesting that Morin might have protective effect on the cardiovascular system ( ). HDL-C has a known protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis ( ). There is an inverse relationship between HDL-C concentration and the incidence of coronary heart disease. HDL reverses cholesterol transport leading to a decrease of cholesterol level. The present study demonstrates a reduction in atherogenic indices LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C of Morin and its formulae compared to HgCl 2 -treated group. This may indicate the protective effect of Morin and its formulae against lung disease induced by HgCl 2 . Allergic rhinitis (AR) caused from a complex allergen-driven mucosal inflammation occurring from a vicious cycle between resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells ( ). Mercuric chloride can cause allergy-driven mucosal inflammation ( ). In the present study, elevated level of CRP, HP, IgE, IgG, haptoglobin, and histamine in HgCl 2 -treated group reflected the abnormalities in lung tissues that can result from development of inflammation. With these facts, we selected a natural compound, Morin, a major anti-inflammatory compound ( ). In this report, we demonstrated that Morin and its formulae obviously reduces Hg-induced allergy-driven mucosal inflammation and decreased obviously levels of plasma CRP, HP, IgE, IgG, haptoglobin, and histamine. These results indicate that Morin and its formulae modulate the general immunity in HgCl 2 -treated rats with better results with F3 SNEDD and F6 NE formulae. In addition, Morin formulae did not cause any side effect compared to Morin-treated rats. This result agreed with previous work. Nitric oxide plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of airway diseases and the control of airway inflammation ( ). NO is formed by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) from the l -arginine, and three isoforms of this enzyme have been known in human airways ( ). The third isoform of NOS (iNOS) is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines and is present in several types of cells, including inflammatory cells and epithelial cells. There is increasing evidence that endogenous NO may increase airway inflammation. Recent evidence states that it may be derived from the very high levels in the paranasal sinuses. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that NO may also be derived from NOS expressed in the nasal mucosa. This may help to support previous study, in which nasal NO was increased in patients with allergic rhinitis and decreased after treatment with nasal glucocorticosteroids ( ).
Our study clarifies that the treatment of rats with HgCl 2 decreased lung Caspase-3, GSH, CAT, and GPx level obviously and increased MDA level. The principal toxic effects of mercury are interactions with a large number of cellular processes leading to oxidative stress. Glutathione, as both carrier of mercury and an antioxidant, has specific roles in protecting the body from mercury toxicity. GSH binds with mercury, forming a complex that prevents mercury from causing damage to both enzymes and tissue. As a result, subsequent elimination of intracellular glutathione levels of GSH are lowered in the cell and decrease the antioxidant potential of the cell. In the present study, Morin and its formulae increase caspase-3, GSH, CAT, and GPx and decrease MDA content of the lung due to HgCl 2 treatment. It appears that Morin and its formulae exert its protective effect against mercury directly through its antioxidant properties or indirectly through maintaining the hepatic GSH; however, the formulae showed better results compared to Morin. So far, Morin exhibits a number of pharmacological effects ( ). The compound is also used as a potential therapeutic agent for several virus diseases, including chronic hepatitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and herpes infection ( ). In our present study, no side effects or abnormality was appeared on Morin and/or its formulae treated rats. Some studies have used total serum IgE and histamine for evaluating allergic disease ( ). IL-6 is one of the key mediators for allergic response. It was first recognized as a B cell growth factor and among other properties, it enhances antigen presenting capacity of these cells and is important for the IgE synthesis ( ). Our results demonstrate that the treatment of rats with HgCl 2 elevated lung gene expression of IL-6 level. IL-6 levels have been found to be obviously increased in symptomatic subjects with allergic diseases. Positive correlations were found between the levels of IgE, histamine, and IL-6 of HgCl 2 -treated rats. In this report, we demonstrated that Morin and its formulae obviously inhibit lung gene expression of IL-6 level with better results with F3 SNEDD and F6 NE formulae. Additionally, they prevented the increase in IgG, IgE levels in the serum of HgCl 2 -treated rats.
CONCLUSION
MPLC is confirmed as an excellent preparative chromatographic tool that is now used in laboratories instead of tedious process. The large amounts of separated sample and low cost are the main benefits of this chromatographic method. Morin-loaded F3 SNEDDS and F6 NE showed spherical shape within the nano-range (< 20 nm) with the highest zeta potential and percent dissolved within the Q 10 min . Morin and its formulae modulate the general immunity in HgCl 2 -treated rats. However, the F3 SNEDD and F6 NE formulae produced better results. Furthermore, Morin and its formulae did not show any side effect compared to Morin-untreated rats.
