Introduction
Gliomas account for more than 50 % of primary brain tumors (Ceramilac and Berger ). The etiology of gliomas remains poorly understood. Some studies suggested positive relations between glioma susceptibility and occupational and environmental exposures (El-Zein et al. ; Kreth et al. ; Musicco et al. ). Recent studies revealed that the genetic background contributing to the susceptibility to gliomas (Kilburn et al. ; Kondratieva et al. ; Jha et al. ; Caggana et al. ; Fan et al. ). The association of several candidate gene polymorphisms with the risk and prognosis of gliomas has been reported (McKean-Cowdin et al. ; Carpentier et al. ; Pinto et al. ; Wang et al. ; McClung et al. ).
Hypoxia plays a central role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (Mendichovszky and Jackson ). In solid tumors, the vascular system fails to supply the rapidly growing tumor mass with adequate amounts of oxygen, resulting in low oxygen tensions, nutrient deprivation and hypoxia (Yeung et al. ; Hill et al. ; Lopez-Lazaro ). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and has been suggested as playing an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis, energy metabolism, vasomotor function and apoptotic/proliferative responses (Chun et al. ; Fang et al. ; Raheja et al. ). Previous studies suggest that HIF-1α is a major mediator for the biological behaviors of tumor cells, including aggressiveness, proliferation, survival and resistance to anti-tumor therapy (Semenza ; Galanis et al. ; Semenza ).
A recent study showed that HIF-1α expression is associated with the survival in high-grade gliomas (Erpolat et al. ). In vitro study showed that HIF mediates the hypoxia induces autophagy in human GBM cell lines (Hu et al. ). HIF-1α regulated protein expression and oligodendroglioma patient outcome (Abraham et al. ). HIF-1α activation is a crucial mechanism involved in hypoxia-induced differential radio resistant in U87 gliomas (Hsieh et al. ).
HIF-1α expression is regulated by its gene polymorphism. Recently, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely, the c .1772T > C (leading to p.P582S) and c .1790G > A (leading to p.A588T) of the HIF-1α gene have been reported. These mutations significantly affect the gene transcriptional activity, thus correlated with an altered expression of their proteins (Vainrib et al. ; Li et al. ).
To date, there is no study addressing the association between HIF-1α genetic polymorphism and the susceptibility to gliomas and its prognosis. In the present study, we enrolled patients with gliomas to investigate the role of HIF-1α genetic polymorphism at c .1772T > C and c .1790G > A in the incidence and prognosis of gliomas in a Chinese cohort.
Methods
Patients
This study included 387 gliomas patients who were treated at Department of Neurosurgery of Daping Hospital affiliated to the Third Military Medical University from March 2005 to August 2011. All tissue specimens were obtained at initial diagnosis by resection or by biopsy before initial resection and were classified morphologically and graded according to the current WHO system (grades: WHO I, WHO II, WHO III and WHO IV) (Chen et al. ; Smith et al. ). The tumor was biopsied under computerized tomography (CT) guidance for histological analyses. A total of 437 age- and sex-matched healthy tumor-free volunteers were recruited from annual checkup visitors as control subjects. All participants were genetically unrelated ethnic Han Chinese people. Each eligible subject was interviewed by two physicians blind to the study protocol to obtain information on demographic factors, family history of cancer, smoking status and other health characteristics. Smokers were defined as those who had smoked more than one cigarette per day and more than 1 year in their lifetime. The exclusion criteria for healthy subjects included central nervous system-related disease, self-reported history of any cancer and previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy for unknown disease conditions. This study received approval from the institutional review boards of Third Military Medical University. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the present study.
Determination of Vital Status
Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics at diagnosis; treatment characteristics including surgery extent and number; chemotherapy (type, dose and duration), radiation (dose, field and duration); and date of death or last follow-up. Survival time was calculated beginning at the date of hospital registration.
HIF-1α Genotyping
HIF-1α genetic polymorphism of c. 1772C > T and c. 1790G > A was assessed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), as described previously (Alves et al. ). Briefly, PCR for HIF-1α was performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing approximately 100 ng genomic DNA as a template. The PCR conditions included denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57.4 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The forward primer sequence was 5′-AAG GTG TGG CCA TTG TAA AAA CTC-3′, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′-CAG TGG TAG TGG TGG C-3′. This primer pair produced a fragment of 240 bp. The 240-bp PCR product of the HIF-1α gene was digested using SsiI (Acil) restriction endonuclease (Fermentas Life Sciences) for the G1790A polymorphism (rs11549467). The substitution from G to A allele produces a single cut site to give two bands of 146 and 94 bp. For the C1772T polymorphism (rs11549465), a 240-bp PCR product of the HIF-1α gene was digested using HphI restriction endonuclease (Fermentas Life Sciences). The substitution from a C to a T allele produces a single cut site to produce two bands of 131 and 109 bp.
Western Blot Analyses for HIF-1α from Tumor Samples
A total of 25 tumor samples were obtained from brain surgery, of which eight were histologically and grade matched. All samples were lysed, and protein concentrations were determined by absorption at 595 nm of diluted protein extract (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) relative to bovine serum albumin standards. Ten micrograms of protein were separated by SDS–PAGE (12 %). After transferring, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the HIF-1α (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and β-actin antibodies (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After incubation with peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG at 37 °C for 3 h, bound proteins were visualized and detected using BioImaging Systems (UVP Inc., Upland, CA, USA). The relative protein levels were calculated based on β-actin as the loading control.
Glioma Cell Line Preparation and siRNA Transfection
Human glioma U251 cells derived from grade IV astrocytoma–glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from Cell Bank Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CBTCCCAS, Shanghai, China) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GIBCO) with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . siRNAs targeted against HIF-1α were designed according to the gene coding sequence of rat HIF-1α obtained from GeneBank. Three potential target mRNA sequences were selected, and siRNA sequences were determined using online design software ( www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.htm ): 1:P1:5′-AGUGACUGAUUCUGGCAGCTT-3′, P2: 5′-GCUGCCAGAAUCAGUCACUTT-3′; 2:P1: 5′-GGAUGACUUUAAGCAAGAATT-3′, P2: 5′-UUCUUGCUUAAAGUCAUCCTT-3′; 3:P1: 5′-GAAACUCUUCCAAGCAAUUTT-3′, P2: 5′-AAUUGCUUGGAAGAGUUUCTT-3′ The mixture containing siRNA sequences was then transfected into cultured cells, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for analyses (Xu et al. ). The expression of HIF-1α expression after transfection was detected by cells by western blot assay.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate right after si-RNA transfection. The medium was discarded, and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 562 nm (with 630 nm as the reference wavelength) using an ELISA microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Assays were repeated at least three times.
Cell Invasion and Migration Assay
The cell invasion and migration ability was evaluated using transwell inserts with 8 µm pores (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). For invasion assay, 2 × 10 5 cells in serum-free medium were added to each upper compartment of the chamber precoated with Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After incubation for 48 h, noninvasive cells were removed from the upper surface of the transwell membrane, and migrated cells were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa and photographed under the microscope. For migration assay, 2 × 10 5 cells were placed into the top chamber without Matrigel matrix precoated. Finally, the cells in lower compartment of the chamber that had invaded to the basal side of the membrane were counted using a light microscope in five random visual fields (×200) (Zhou et al. ).
Statistical Analysis
The Fisher’s exact chi-square test was first used to compare the frequency distribution of age, gender, smoking status, body mass index (BMI) between cases and controls, if appropriate. The overall survival (OS) rate was defined as the percentage of patients who are alive 2 years after their diagnosis or the start of treatment. The OS rate was compared using log-rank test. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses to estimate the effect of HIF-1α polymorphisms on survival in the presence of other known prognostic factors, including age, sex, smoke, extent of tumor resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) (Konac et al. ). Analyses were performed using the software SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All P values were two-sided, and a P value <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
The Characteristics of Patients and Control
The characteristics of case patients and controls are summarized in Table 1 . The mean age at diagnosis, sex and BMI were similar between glioma patients and controls. However, the percentage for smokers and tumor family history were significantly higher in glioma group than control group ( P = 0.030 and P < 0.001, respectively).

Association Between HIF-1α Genotype and Risk of Gliomas
The genotype frequencies of both SNPs of HIF-1α at c. 1772T > C and c. 1790G > A were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (all P > 0.05). The genotype distribution and allele frequency at 1790A > G were similar between the patients and controls (Table 2 ). However, there was a significant difference in the genotype distribution of c. 1772T > C between the gliomas and control groups ( P < 0.001). The 1772TT genotype was significantly more prevalent in patient than in controls (28.94 vs. 15.33 %, P < 0.001). Subsequently, the T allele frequency was markedly higher in glioma subjects than in controls (52.07 vs. 40.05 %, P < 0.001, Table 2 ). In order to determine whether the HIF-1α gene polymorphism independently associated with the risk of gliomas, we performed the multivariable regression analyses. A forward stepwise (likelihood ratio) procedure was used for multivariable analysis. By multivariable analyses, a significantly higher risk for gliomas was observed in 1772TT genotype carriers of HIF-1α (odds ratio 2.68, 95 % CI 1.81–3.98, P < 0.001, with CC as reference, Table 2 ) after adjustment with age, sex, BMI, smoke status and family history. The c. 1790G > A genotype and allele distribution were not significantly different between gliomas and control groups ( P = 0.19 for c. 1790G > A genotype and P = 0.46 for c. 1790G > A allele, respectively, Table 2 ). Multivariable regression analyses did not reveal any association between the c. 1790G > A genotype and allele with the susceptibility to gliomas in our study (all P > 0.05, Table 2 ).

Gliomas Histological Grades According to Genotypes
We further analyzed the histological grade according to the genotypes of two loci of HIF-1α gene (Table 3 ). We combined the grade I and II as low-grade subgroup ( n = 166) and grade III and IV as high-grade subgroup ( n = 211). For c. 1772T > C polymorphisms, we found there was a markedly higher prevalence of TT carriers in high-grade subgroup (III + IV) than in low-grade subgroup (I + II) (35.75 vs. 24.10 %, P = 0.012); while for the c .1790G > A genotype polymorphisms, the genotype distributions were similar two subgroups ( P = 0.762). Multivariable analyses showed individuals with 1772TT had a significantly higher risk for grade III + IV gliomas (odds ratio 2.331, 95 % CI 1.276–3.902, P = 0.008, with 1772CC as reference) after adjustment with age, sex, BMI, smoke status and family history, using 1772CC as the reference.

Western Blot for HIF-1α from Tumor Samples
The genotypes of the tested tumor samples were as follows: 8 were 1790GG, 11 were 1790GA and 6 were 1790AA; 3 were 1772CC, 12 were 1772CT and 10 were 1772TT. We performed quantitative analysis to compare the protein levels in tumors with different genotypes. Figure 1 shows the representative HIF-1α protein levels in samples from different c .1790G > A and c. 1772C > T genotype carriers. The 1772TT carriers had significantly higher HIF-1α protein levels than 1772CT and CC carriers. In contrast, the c. 1790G > A genotype carriers had similar HIF-1α expressions levels. Fig. 1 The HIF-1α expressions in c. 1790G > A and c. 1772C > T genotype carriers. It shows the representative HIF-1α protein bands in samples from gliomas patients ( a and b samples from two patients with astrocytomas; c and d , samples from two patients with glioblastoma). In all samples, the 1772TT carriers had significantly higher HIF-1α protein levels than 1772CT and CC carriers. In contrast, the c. 1790G > A genotype carriers had similar HIF-1α expressions levels in these samples
Follow-Up Analyses
Survival follow-up were carried out on all patients who had undergone surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Log-rank test showed that OS rate of patients who had TT of c. 1772T > C polymorphisms (30.2 %) and CT genotype carriers (31.0 %) was markedly shorter compared with patients with CC (70.8 %, P < 0.01, Fig. 2 a). For the SNPs at c.1790G>A locus, there was no significant difference in OS rates among different genotype carriers (GG: 45.6 %; GA: 45.5 %; AA: 45.6 %, P > 0.05). Figure 2 b shows the OS rates according to the tumor grade. The stage III + IV group had a dramatically lower OS rate (26.4 %) than stage I + II group (67.7 %, P < 0.001). Fig. 2 The OS period in glioma patients according to c. 1772C > T polymorphisms and tumor grade. a Log-rank test shows that patients with CC of c. 1772T > C had significantly longer OS rate (70.8 %), compared with those with CT (30.2 %) and TT (31.0 %) genotype carriers ( P < 0.001). b shows the OS rates according to the tumor grade. The stage III + IV group had a dramatically lower OS rate than stage I + II group (26.4 vs. 67.7 %), ( P < 0.001)
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to estimate the crude HRs, adjusted HRs for OS in cases and their 95 % CIs, with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, family history of cancer, smoke status, histology, WHO grade and therapy status. Compared with the CC carriers of c. 1772T > C , the HRs of TT genotype for death were 2.87 (95 % CI 1.45–4.19, P = 0.002). The polymorphisms of c. 1790G > A did not show this trend (data not shown).
HIF-1α Regulated the Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of U251 Cells
Western blot results showed that the HIF-1α protein expressions in U251 cells were significantly inhibited by SIRT1 si-RNA silencing technique (Fig. 3 a). The cell proliferation assays revealed the cell growth rate was significantly inhibited in U251 cells after HIF-1α si-RNA transfection compared with cells treated with control si-RNA (0.64 ± 0.15 vs. 0.28 ± 0.11, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 b). Cell migration assay showed that HIF-1α knockdown significantly decreased the migrated cell numbers (42 ± 3 vs. 28 ± 5, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 c). Furthermore, silencing of HIF-1α gene dramatically inhibited the invasive ability of U251 cells (31 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 d). Fig. 3 The proliferation, migration and invasion changes of U251 cells after HIF-1α and control si-RNA transfection. a shows that the HIF-1α protein expressions in U251 cells were significantly inhibited by HIF-1α si-RNA silencing technique. b shows the cell proliferation rate was significantly inhibited in U251 cells after HIF-1α si-RNA transfection compared with cells treated with control si-RNA (OD value at 562 nm: 0.64 ± 0.15 vs. 0.28 ± 0.11, P < 0.001). c shows the migrated cell numbers were significantly decreased by HIF-1α inhibition compared with normal U251 cells (42 ± 3 vs. 28 ± 5, P < 0.001, Fig. 3 c). d shows the invasive cell numbers were inhibited by HIF-1α gene silencing in U251 cells than normal cells (31 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5, P < 0.001)
Discussion
HIF-1α is a key regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and has been suggested as playing an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, energy metabolism, vasomotor function and apoptotic/proliferative responses (Chun et al. ; Fang et al. ; Raheja et al. ).
HIF-1α over-expression is described in a host of human cancers: prostate, squamous cell carcinoma, lung, breast, bladder and pancreas (Welsh and Powis ; Hiraga et al. ; Bos et al. ). Several studies have also demonstrated that increased HIF-1α activity is a predictor of a more aggressive tumor grade, tumor invasion, resistance to radiation therapy and metastatic potential and is associated with a poorer prognosis (Aebersold et al. ; Bos et al. ; Pennacchietti et al. ). There is an important single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of human HIF-1α gene at 1772; the wild-type cytosine (C) allele is replaced by a thymine (T) allele (named C1772T or P582S or rs11549465), leading to an amino acid substitution of proline with serine. The role of this polymorphism in various types of cancer has been widely investigated, but the results were inconsistent. Positive association was reported between T allele of c. 1772T > C and increased risk of cervical cancer (Konac et al. ), pancreatic cancer (Wang et al. ), oral cancer (Chen et al. ) and head and neck cancer (Hebert et al. ), while not associated with colorectal cancer (Lee et al. ), lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other cancers. Zhao et al. ( ) conducted a meta-analysis using 16 case–control studies and concluded that c. 1772T > C is significantly associated with higher cancer risk and that c. 1790G > A is only significantly associated with breast cancer. A recent meta-study by He et al. ( ) suggested that HIF-1α gene c. 1772T > C polymorphism is a risk factor of cancer, especially for cervical, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer and renal cell carcinoma. However, Liu and Zhang ( ) reported that the c. 1790G > A polymorphism and not the c. 1772T > C polymorphism is significantly associated with cancer risk. Thus, the role of HIF-1α polymorphism in carcinoma still needs further study.
The HIF-1α gene is located at chromosome 14q21–q24. In vitro studies have demonstrated that under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, the c. 1772T > C and c. 1790G > A polymorphisms of the HIF-1α gene have a higher transcriptional activity, correlated with an over-expression of the corresponding protein, compared with the transcriptional activity and protein expression of the wild-type sequence (Tanimoto et al. ; Clifford et al. ; Nava-Salazar et al. ). In our study, we performed western blot analyses from tumor samples. We found that the TT carrier of c. 1772C > T had significantly higher HIF-1α protein expression than CT and CC carriers. In contrast, the c. 1790G > A carriers had similar HIF-1α expressions. Clinically, an association has been found between the presence of HIF-1α polymorphism and the development of diseases in which an altered HIF-1α is implicated, such as cancer, diabetes and coronary disease in various groups among different populations (Hebert et al. ; Putra et al. ; Kim et al. ).
A meta-analysis suggests that the HIF-1α c. 1772C > T polymorphism is significantly associated with higher cancer risk, and the c. 1790G > A polymorphism is significantly associated only with decreased breast cancer risk (Zhao et al. ). The effect of the c. 1772C > T polymorphism on cancer especially exists in Caucasians and female subjects. Only female-specific cancers were included in female subgroup, which indicates that the c. 1772C > T polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk for female-specific cancers. The association between the c. 1790G > A polymorphism and lower breast cancer risk could be due to chance (Zhao et al. ). In this study, we found that the genotype distribution at c. 1772C > T showed significant difference between patient and control groups. Multivariable analyses showed a significantly higher risk for gliomas in TT genotype carriers (odds ratio 2.68, with CC as reference). Our finding added more knowledge of HIF-1α c. 1772C > T on cancer susceptibility. In addition, we also found a significantly higher risk for grade III + IV gliomas was observed in TT genotype carriers of c. 1772C > T (odds ratio 2.21, with CC as reference) after adjustment. This suggest that the c. 1772C > T polymorphisms may be used as a molecular marker for gliomas occurrence and grades.
A recent study showed that HIF-1α expression is associated with the survival in high-grade gliomas (Erpolat et al. ). In this study, we also investigated the prognostic role of HIF-1α in gliomas patients. We found that OS rate of patients who had TT of c. 1772C > T polymorphisms and CT genotype carriers was markedly shorter compared with patients with CC ( P < 0.01). This result suggests that the polymorphism at c. 1772C > T locus may be used for predict the clinical outcome in glioma patients.
Several limitations should be addressed in this study. The sample in this study is relatively small and limited to Chinese patients, thus the conclusion of this study warrants further confirmation in multi-ethnic population with larger scale. Secondly, the molecular mechanism under which the polymorphism at c. 1772C > T locus affects the glioma cells and the prognosis in gliomas patients is not elucidated in this study.
