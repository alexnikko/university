Introduction
Exposure-response (E-R) modeling of clinical endpoints is important for the selection of optimal dose and dosing regimen [ ]. Longitudinal E-R modeling is particularly important for dosing frequency selection [ ]. A widely used class of longitudinal E-R models includes the Types I–IV indirect response (IDR) models [ ]. These models have been used increasingly to characterize clinical endpoints with the mechanistic delay in drug action. These approaches have been argued as appropriately parsimonious for clinical endpoints [ ].
Residual error is generally a nuisance component of E-R modeling but may affect its performance. Autocorrelation residual error (AR1) modeling generally accommodates the correlation between two observations after conditioning on subject-specific random effects. This correlation appears plausible and its implementation has long been supported by software such as NONMEM [ ], however its application in pharmacometrics has been rare. This may be explained by a recent investigation by Hutmacher [ ], showing that AR1 modeling improves predictions of longitudinal response profiles at the individual level but not the population level, unless the autocorrelation is very high. Predicting the population response profiles has been noted as the more important objective in most clinical trial applications [ ]. On the other hand, it remains plausible that improved response profiles at the individual level could result in better understanding of drug effect, particularly in certain sub-populations of interest. This may be especially relevant for response-adaptive designs, where subjects are assigned to subsequent treatments based on their responses, and it is of interest to predict the response in the resulted treatment subgroups.
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which is by definition limited to the colon. The disease activity is most often evaluated with the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), a composite endpoint which includes patient symptoms, physician assessments and lab parameters [ ], and incurs considerable variation in its administration and scoring [ ]. Treatment effectiveness is commonly assessed by rates of clinical response or remission, defined as certain improvement in CDAI for response and an absolute score <150 for remission. Clinical trials of biologics in CD often employ complex study designs with the aim of evaluating treatment effectiveness during induction and maintenance phases, and treatment received in the maintenance phase typically depends on earlier responses: responders may be re-randomized, and non-responders may receive higher doses or be discontinued. Because of the mutual exclusiveness of the responder/non-responder status, the maintenance treatment subgroups are not statistically independent from each other. This complicates model evaluation and interpretations. Nevertheless, satisfactory model performance in each of the respective treatment subgroups is still needed, in accord with the objectives of the study designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between study design and model performance. Challenges in accurately describing data in post response-adaptation periods with longitudinal E-R modeling have been previously noted [ ]. To our knowledge, no longitudinal E-R modeling of CDAI has yet been published.
Ustekinumab (Stelara ® ; Janssen Biotech, Inc, Horsham, PA, USA) is a human immunoglobulin G 1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity and affinity to the shared p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 [ , ]. It is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and most recently moderate to severe CD. Ustekinumab effectively neutralizes all IL-12 (Th1) and IL-23 (Th17) mediated cellular responses. Abnormal regulation of IL-12 and IL-23 has been associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases, including IBD, and clinical data supports that ustekinumab provides effective therapy in CD [ , ].
This manuscript discusses the challenges associated with longitudinal E-R modeling using data from three phase III clinical trials of ustekinumab with complex study designs in patients with CD through Week 52 [ ].
Methods
Data and information used for E-R modeling
Model development and evaluation were performed using data from three phase III clinical trials UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI [ ]. These were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter trials of ustekinumab in patients who have moderate to severe CD, with baseline CDAI score ≥220. UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 were induction studies; at Week 8, all patients continued into the IM-UNITI maintenance study. Patients in UNITI-1 had failed previous treatments with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. Patients in UNITI-2 had failed conventional therapy, but predominantly had not previously failed anti-TNF agents; 68.5% were anti-TNF-naïve. In both UNITI-1 and UNITI-2, patients in the induction phase at Week 0 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of placebo, ustekinumab 130 mg, or an ustekinumab weight-range based dose of approximating 6 mg/kg (i.e., patients weighing ≤55 kg received 260 mg, those weighing >55 kg and ≤85 kg received 390 mg, and those weighing >85 kg received 520 mg) at baseline. Clinical response was defined as achieving: (i) a reduction from baseline in the CDAI score of ≥100 points or (ii) a CDAI score of <150, if the baseline CDAI score was 220–248 points. For the purposes of re-randomization in the IM-UNITI maintenance study, responders during the induction phase were defined as those who achieved clinical response at Week 8. The IM-UNITI maintenance study started at Week 8 following the induction phase, and responders in the ustekinumab groups were re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with subcutaneous (SC) injections of placebo, ustekinumab 90 mg q12 weeks, or ustekinumab 90 mg q8 weeks until study-end. Nonresponders in the ustekinumab groups were assigned to receive an injection of SC ustekinumab 90 mg q8 weeks from Week 8. Non-responders in the placebo group were assigned to IV ustekinumab 130 mg at Week 8. Responders in the induction placebo group continued to receive SC placebo. At Week 16 (Week 8 of the IM-UNITI study), patients who were nonresponders to IV placebo or ustekinumab induction were discontinued if they had still not attained clinical response, and if they had shifted to become responders, they were assigned to SC ustekinumab 90 mg either q12 weeks (IV placebo induction non-responders) or q8 weeks (IV ustekinumab induction non-responders) until study-end. A study design schema for the induction phase and the induction-responders portion of the maintenance phase is provided in the top portion of Fig. 1 [ ]. A study design schema for the induction non-responders portion of the maintenance phase is provided in the lower portion of Fig. 1 . Serum ustekinumab concentrations and CDAI scores were evaluated at Weeks 0 (1 h post-infusion), 3, 6, 8 and every 4 weeks thereafter until study-end.

Bottom maintenance phase for induction non-responders
In terms of evaluating the overall induction and maintenance effects, it may be helpful to view the three studies as one. As noted, the study design structure is highly complex, especially for the IM-UNITI study which essentially classified the patients into the following subgroups based on induction treatment groups and responder/non-responder status at weeks 8 and 16: induction placebo responders, induction active-treatment responders, induction non-responders; and furthermore, induction non-responders who responded to additional treatment. Understanding the performance of E-R modeling in these four subgroups, in addition to the induction phase, is important for the interpretation of clinical results.
Data available for E-R analysis included 764 subjects initially enrolling in UNITI-1 and 637 subjects in UNITI-2, with a total of 15,100 CDAI score evaluations across the three phase III studies. Demographic characteristics of the subjects who were used in the current analysis can be found in the previous work [ , ].
Population PK modeling
Population PK modeling following SC administration of ustekinumab using a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination, as has been previously published [ , ]. Due to the availability of data following IV injection in this analysis, a population PK model using a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination was developed with body weight as the main covariate for both clearance and volume of distribution. The average clearance and absolute bioavailability were estimated as 0.19 (L/day) and 78%, respectively. The complete results will be reported elsewhere. Individual empirical Bayesian PK parameter estimates based on the population PK model were obtained in a sequential approach for the E-R analysis.
E-R model
The CDAI scores were modeled by adopting a semi-mechanistic approach applied in earlier E-R analyses [ ] as: $${\text{CDAI}}\left( {\text{t}} \right) \, = {\text{ b }} - {\text{ f}}_{\text{p}} \left( {\text{t}} \right) \, - {\text{ f}}_{\text{d}} \left( {\text{t}} \right) \, + {{\varepsilon}}$$ (1) where CDAI(t) is the observed CDAI score, ε represents the within-subject variability with a normal distribution [N(0, σ 2 )], b is baseline CDAI score, f p (t) is placebo effect, and f d (t) is drug effect. The placebo effect was modeled empirically as: $${\text{f}}_{\text{p}} \left( {\text{t}} \right) \, = {\text{ b}} * {\text{F}} * \left[ { 1 { } - { \exp }\left( { - {\text{rt}}} \right)} \right]$$ (2) where 0 ≤ F ≤ 1 is the maximum placebo effect on the proportional scale and r is the rate of onset. The drug effect was modeled as: $${\text{f}}_{\text{d}} \left( {\text{t}} \right) \, = {\text{ b }}\left( { 1 - {\text{ F}}} \right){\text{ E}}_{ \hbox{max} } \left[ { 1 - {\text{ R}}\left( {\text{t}} \right)} \right]$$ (3) where 0 ≤ E max ≤ 1 represents maximum drug effect, with R(t) governed by: $${\frac{\text{dR(t)}}{{\text{dt}}} \ \, = \, \mathop {\text{k}}\nolimits_{\text{in}} \, \left( { 1- \, \frac{{\mathop {\mathop {\text{C}}\nolimits_{\text{p}} }\nolimits }}{{\mathop {E{\text{C}}}\nolimits_{ 5 0} + \, \mathop {\mathop {\text{C}}\nolimits_{\text{p}} }\nolimits }}} \right) \, - \, \mathop {\text{k}}\nolimits_{\text{out}} \, \mathop {\text{R(t)}}\nolimits }$$ (4) where C p is the drug concentration, and k in , EC 50 , and k out are parameters in a Type I IDR model. It was further assumed that R = 1 at baseline, i.e., R(0) = 1, yielding k in = k out . The standard IDR model form has the E max term in Eq. 4 instead of in Eq. 3 . In our experience, results are indistinguishable but estimation is faster in the current form. This IDR model representation corresponds to a change-from-baseline parameterization, and R(t) represents a latent variable of the disease process. In practice, data may not allow clear separation between the Type I–IV IDR models. For change-from-baseline latent variable, Type I and Type III models are closely related; the theoretical characteristics have been discussed before [ ]. The Type I IDR model was chosen in consideration of its inhibitory effect of IL-12 and IL-23, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of ustekinumab [ ]. The effect of subject population was modeled on the placebo effect (F), in the form of $${\text{logit}}\left( {\text{F}} \right) \, = {\text{ logit}}\left( {{\text{F}}_{ \exp } } \right) \, + {\text{ F}}_{\text{pop}} * {\text{I}}\left( {{\text{Na}}}\ddot{\upiota}{{\text{ve}}} \right)$$ (5) where logit(x) = log[x/(1−x)] is the logit function, F exp is the maximum placebo effect on the proportional scale in the anti-TNF-failure population, F pop is the subject population effect on placebo in the logit scale, and \({\text{I}}\left( {{\text{Na}}}\ddot{\upiota}{{\text{ve}}} \right)\) = 1 for the anti-TNF-failure population, and 0 otherwise. Between-subject variability (BSV) on F exp and E max was modeled assuming logit-normal distributions to restrict their values between [0, 1]. BSVs on other parameters were modeled with lognormal distributions. Correlations between BSVs were modeled on the normal scale.
Autocorrelation residual error model
Let {t i } be the observation times for a subject and {ε i } be the corresponding error terms with correlation matrix Ξ = {Ξ ij }. A spatial autocorrelation structure (AR1) as investigated by Hutmacher [ ] was used, Ξ ij = ρ (| ti−tj |) where ρ is the spatial autocorrelation parameter. Following a conventional parameterization in NONMEM [ ], the parameterization of A r = −log(ρ) was used and A r was estimated instead of ρ.
E-R model estimation and evaluation
A sequential approach described by Zhang et al. [ ] was used for the E-R model estimation by first fixing individual PK parameters to their respective empirical Bayesian parameter estimates obtained from the population PK model. Parameter estimation for the E-R model was implemented in NONMEM using the Importance Sampling option with the aim to improve BSV estimation [ ]. E-R model selection was based on the NONMEM objective function values (OFVs), which are approximately −2 times log likelihood. A change in OFV of 7.88 corresponding to a nominal p value of 0.005 was judged as significant evidence for including an additional parameter. Visual predictive checks (VPCs) [ ] were performed to evaluate model performance by simulating 500 replicates of the dataset and comparing simulated and model-predicted responses.
Results
Figure 2 shows the CDAI scores at planned visits for 100 randomly selected patients. Substantial variation in CDAI scores is apparent. Initial exploratory analysis suggested that average baseline CDAI scores were approximately 20 points higher in UNITI-1 than in UNITI-2. The reason may be partly attributed to patient population differences between anti-TNF-failure vs anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure patients. Leaving this unaddressed would adversely affect model performance and impact the appearance of VPCs [ ]. Therefore, this difference was modeled with an additional parameter b s in Eqs. 1 – 3 by replacing b with (b + b s ). Further refinement in BSV structure resulted in a block structure with BSVs correlated among placebo model parameters (b, F, r) and parameters related to ustekinumab effect (EC 50 , E max ), while BSV of K out was assessed independently. This model is referred to as the Base model for the remainder of this manuscript. Attempts at reducing the number of BSV effects or correlation parameters led to deterioration of VPC results, while inclusion of additional BSV correlations led to unstable parameter estimations. Fig. 2 Observed CDAI scores at planned visits for 100 randomly selected subjects
The observed AR(1) correlation for residuals of the Base model was 0.48 between Week 0 and Week 3, and ranged between 0.75 and 0.89 for subsequent observation times. Adding the AR1 residual error correlation to the Base model significantly improved the model fit, reducing NONMEM objective function by nearly 2000 points. The resulting model is referred to as the AR model for the remainder of this manuscript, and the parameter estimates and their relative standard errors (RSEs) are presented in Table 1 . RSEs for all parameters are reported for convenience, and need to be interpreted with caution for those parameters (e.g., E max ) that may take negative values or are estimated near the high end of their constraints. Estimation precisions as indicated by RSEs were reasonable for baseline (b), maximum placebo effect (F exp ), the associated subject population effects (b s , F pop ) and their respective BSVs. The precisions were moderate for the rate-parameters (placebo effect: r, drug-effect onset: k out ) and their BSVs, which may be expected as these parameters are more difficult to estimate. RSEs were high for ustekinumab effects EC 50 and E max and their BSVs. The percent coefficient of variation of the BSVs for b, EC 50 and K out were 12%, 302%, and 108%, respectively. The large magnitudes of RSEs for EC 50 and E max , the BSVs for the drug effect parameters, and the residual error appeared consistent with the data variability shown in Fig. 2 . The AR1 residual error correlation estimate of 0.0298 corresponds to a correlation of exp(−0.0298*7*4) = 0.434 for observations 4-weeks apart. Compared with these estimates, the Base model had similar fixed effect estimates except that of EC 50 was nearly tripled and that of E max became close to 1, a finding consistent with their high RSEs, and may suggest that ustekinumab exposure levels could be at the low-end of the E-R curve. For the BSV components, the Base model of placebo effects (base, F exp ) increased by approximately 20%, while BSV of drug effects (EC 50 , E max , k out ) decreased by approximately 20–40% from their corresponding AR1 model estimates. This indicates substantial influence on BSV estimation by including AR1.

Maintenance phase: general treatment and subpopulation comparisons
VPCs of the AR model for CDAI scores were conducted for the induction phase and the four maintenance phase subgroups separated by responder/non-responder status in the induction phase. The results for the induction phase, stratified by treatments and patient populations, are shown in Fig. 3 . CDAI scores decreased over time, and ustekinumab was generally more effective than placebo, although differences between the 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg treatments effects were less pronounced in part due to time needed for onset of full drug effect. The anti-TNF-naïve population responded generally better than the anti-TNF-failure population, as the model predicted. Statistical testing results for the subgroup differences were presented earlier [ ]. Overall, the model described the data well for the induction phase. At this stage, the modeling results were consistent with what would be expected of ordinary studies with no treatment re-assignment. Fig. 3 Visual predictive check of Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score in anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure patients for the induction phase. The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of observed CDAI scores are overlaid with the 90% prediction intervals (PI) of their model predictions at planned observation times by treatment. PBO, placebo; TNF-naïve, anti-TNF-naïve; TNF-failure, anti-TNF-failure
VPC results of the induction-responders and non-responders in the maintenance phase are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. Despite apparent biases, general conclusions may be drawn from the model and the observed data. First, the anti-TNF-naïve population responded better than the anti-TNF-failure populations in all treatment groups. This can be seen that the 90% PIs for the median model predictions for the anti-TNF-naïve population were below CDAI of 200 for all treatment groups, while the corresponding PIs for the anti-TNF-failure populations overlapped with CDAI of 200. Secondly, Fig. 4 shows that, for the active-treatment induction responders, ustekinumab was more effective than placebo, although differences between the q12-weeks and q8-weeks regimens were minor.

The observed CDAI scores were included in the background in grey color.

Figure 5 shows that, for the induction non-responders in the re-induction phase between Weeks 12–16, CDAI scores continued to reduce over time. As per study design, only responders at Week 16 (week 8 on IM-UNITI) continued on to receive either the q8-weeks or q12-weeks regimens, which appeared to result in similar CDAI score outcomes.
Interaction between apparent biases and study design in the maintenance phase
For the placebo responders during the induction phase (left portion of Fig. 4 ), while the model over-predicted the median observed CDAI scores, it appeared to reasonably describe the 5% and 95% percentiles. This may be in part due to the fact that, for the observed CDAI scores, the medians were much closer to the 5% percentiles, demonstrating high skewedness in observed CDAI score within this group, thus making the discrepancy between the median observed and model-predicted CDAI scores difficult to improve upon. For the active-treatment responders during the induction phase assigned to the placebo group (right portion of Fig. 4 ), the model appeared to reasonably describe the data. For the q12-weeks and q8-weeks regimens, the model still over-predicted the median CDAI scores, but the magnitude of over-prediction was smaller as the observed CDAI scores appeared to be less skewed towards the lower end.
For the non-responders during the induction phase (left portion of Fig. 5 ), the model generally over-predicted the median observed CDAI scores (especially at Week 16), but appeared to reasonably describe the 5% and 95% percentiles. For the non-responders during the induction phase who responded at Week 16 (right portion of Fig. 5 ), the model reasonably described the 5% but over-predicted the median observed CDAI scores and most of the 95% percentiles. Extensive efforts were made to reduce the over-prediction shown in Fig. 5 with the Base model prior to including AR1 correlation, as the systematic biases were unlikely to be due to covariate effects and furthermore, plotting the empirical Bayesian parameter estimate distributions did not suggest any abnormalities, and the exploration of mixture modeling did not suggest any subgroups. Most attempted models showed over-predictions of the observed CDAI scores up to >100% higher than shown in Fig. 5 around Week 20. Investigation of a number of alternative models that included additional components, e.g., transduction, effect compartment, tolerance, response-mediated effect onset/offset, and other mechanisms as suggested in [ ], resulted in no improvement, suggesting that the apparent discrepancy may be unlikely due to mechanistic deficiency of the model. While there were suggestions of dropout effects, as approximately half of the patients had data at the last visit (Week 52), further investigations in including random or informative dropout [ ] also resulted in no improvement of VPCs.
It is noted that response-adaptive designs may make the application of common modeling intuitions difficult. For example, an artificial additive effect term applied to data post Week 16 in either all treatment groups or only in the non-responders during the induction phase who responded at Week 16 (right portion of Fig. 5 ) could not be supported by the data, which appears to be due to the censoring effect of selecting non-responders at Week 8 and responders at Week 16. This may be a main source of complexity for modeling data from response-adaptive designs. Another aspect of the complexity may be seen in that the model appears to consistently over-predict the medians (but not the 5% or 95% percentiles), except for the Week 16 responders. There thus appears to be an imbalance in the biases among the treatment subgroups, at least for the Week 16 responders group even if predictions were unbiased in the other subgroups. This may be in part due to the Week 16 non-responder discontinuation for the induction non-responders, i.e., this portion of the data is not available.
On the other hand, for most candidate models with BSV estimated for all structural model parameters, even though estimations were unstable, the median model-predicted individual empirical Bayesian CDAI time profiles agreed well with the observed values in the respective re-assigned treatment groups. This suggests that the structural model may be sufficiently flexible in this case, and adequate estimation of sufficient random effects may be especially important for analyzing data from studies involving re-randomizations.
As AR(1) residual error is not often used in E-R modeling, its influence is worth investigating in comparison with the Base model. VPCs of the Base model showed very similar predictive performance to those of the AR model for the induction phase (Fig. 3 ), the induction-responders in the maintenance phase (Fig. 4 ), and induction-non-responders in the maintenance phase prior to Week 16 (left portion of Fig. 5 ) and therefore are not shown. Comparison of the VPCs for the non-responders during the induction phase who responded at Week 16 (right portion of Fig. 5 ) is shown in Fig. 6 . The median model-predicted individual empirical Bayesian CDAI time profiles were close to the observed median CDAI scores for both models. The AR model reduced the overall biases compared with the Base model, which are more noticeable near Week 20.

The 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of observed CDAI scores are overlaid with the 90% prediction intervals (PI) of their model predictions at planned observation times by treatment.

The fact that including AR1 correlation resulted in visibly improved VPC only in the group of non-responders in the induction phase who responded to re-induction in the maintenance phase may be explained by the fact that at the time of treatment adaption, a subject may be viewed as going through a transition, e.g., from a non-responder in the general population to a responder in a sub-population that is more sensitive to treatment. It is therefore conceivable that adequate characterization of individual subject characteristics, i.e., BSVs, becomes more important for analyzing and visualizing such data. The Markov approach has been shown to describe individual transitions well [ ]. Recently, Hutmacher noted a close link between the Markov approach and AR1 residual error correlation [ ]. Therefore, the improvement that resulted from AR1 correlation may be expected as a partial compensation from the inadequately characterized BSVs due to the complex study design.
Discussion
It is well-recognized that dose-titration trials provide only limited information in dose-response, as the relationship would be flat if all patients achieve the maximum response. Similarly, trials with “dose optimization” phases where inadequate responders receive higher doses provide less information on E-R than “treat through” trials where treatments do not depend on response. Other response-dependent trials, e.g., re-randomization and randomized withdrawal, create a different kind of challenge in that the patients were divided into subpopulations with different sensitivities to the drug (and other factors affecting response, e.g., onset rates) relating to their specific previous treatment regimens. Therefore, the effectiveness of the maintenance treatment regimens also depends on the induction regimens. The subpopulations are mutually exclusive and thus not statistically independent, unlike the subpopulations under usual parallel-group designs. This creates challenges to data visualization and interpretation, as biases in one treatment group likely relate to biases in certain other groups. Conceivably, the challenges become elevated when the response is highly variable such as the CDAI score. This may partly explain the complexities in modeling data from CD trials, which often employ more than one response-dependent treatment assignment as shown in Fig. 1 .
This is a first attempt of longitudinal E-R modeling of CDAI scores in CD that involves complex clinical trial designs. Exposure-response relationship in the induction phase was reasonably described by the model. However, in the maintenance phase, CDAI scores in certain groups after re-assignment appeared somewhat over-predicted by the model. No other random effects models could improve the fit. Incorporating AR1 residual error correlation improved the predictions in the group of induction non-responders who responded to additional treatment, as shown in Fig. 6 . It is of conceptual interest to understand whether the AR1 model could help to correctly identify or classify the different groups of subjects, as measured by responder rates, randomized to treatment changes in the maintenance, re-induction, and non-responder discontinuation phases. This was attempted in the form of VPCs, but no informative result could be obtained due to the large residual error estimates, consistent with the variable nature of CDAI [ ]. That is, such investigations might require a much larger number of subjects than in the available dataset. Extensive investigations suggest that accurate predictions in post-re-randomization periods may require accurate characterization of distributions of BSVs which, in our experience, may be difficult when the data from fewer than 2,000 patients are available. The importance of incorporating BSV effects was recently noted by Hutmacher [ ].
Despite the biases noted in model description of data in certain treatment groups for which no conventional “optimal” model could be established, useful conclusions may still be derived from the E-R modeling. The high value of parameter estimates of E max , even though the RSEs were high, suggest the potential of increasing efficacy with increased doses beyond the tested doses despite the apparent lack of difference between the q8-weeks and q12-weeks maintenance regimens. Furthermore, Fig. 5 suggests that even in those periods where the model under-predicts the treatment effect, the magnitude of observed treatment differences appeared similar to that of the model-predicted treatment differences. Since accurate predictions of relative dosing regimen differences are often more important than the absolute efficacy magnitudes in achieving desired levels of dose regimen separation in clinical dosing decisions, the longitudinal E-R model may still help guide efficient clinical drug development. In this regard, the similarity between outcomes in the q12 week and the q8 week dosing regimens, as indicated by Figs. 3 and 4 , suggests the importance of informative longitudinal E-R model development for phase III dose regimen selection. This implies in turn the importance of phase II study design planning to allow informative longitudinal E-R model development at that stage, e.g., by incorporating a washout period to allow the rate of treatment effect offset to be accurately identified. In addition, as E-R modeling is becoming increasingly important in clinical dose and dosing regimens decisions, the complexities caused by re-randomization designs should be considered and managed at the planning stage.
Figures 4 - 5 suggest some skewness of CDAI outcomes that are more apparent at the lower ranges, and thus the potential need of asymmetric transformations. Applications of this type have recently been used in E-R modeling of composite clinical endpoints [ ]. However, as CDAI may take negative values, a transformation will likely require two or more parameters. Furthermore, common CDAI-based clinical response criteria such as clinical remission are based on certain improvement of CDAI scores from baseline, and nonlinear transformations may not improve the predictive ability on these criteria. The applicability of transformations is an interesting area of future research.
When the estimation of E max and EC 50 is inaccurate, E max is often fixed to 1 to increase the precision of EC 50 . This usually has little impact on how the model describes the existing data. On the other hand, it moves the estimation imprecision to the background of assumptions and may result in over-optimism in model-prediction precisions, especially when extrapolating to higher dose ranges. In this regard, it is likely better to leave the term in the model unless it hinders the estimation of other parameters or prevents model convergence.
The model(s) could potentially be improved in many aspects. For example, for the induction-responders assigned to the placebo treatment in the maintenance phase, the median observed CDAI time course could be increasing more than what the model predicted, more notably for the anti-TNF-naïve population. This might suggest a difference in either placebo progress or drug effect washout between the patient populations. Furthermore, covariate influences on drug effect model parameters could be explored. Higher order of autocorrelation [AR(n)] is also conceptually possible, however to our knowledge they have rarely, if ever, been applied in pharmacometrics, in part due to the complexity of implementation. Investigating these issues further is of value from the conventional modeling perspective but would deviate from the focus of this manuscript, and thus was not pursued.
In conclusion, this work illustrates some often under-realized complexities in the E-R analysis and interpretation of data from complex study designs. Auto-correlation residual error modeling may be expected to play an important role in the longitudinal modeling of data with complex study designs with response-dependent treatment assignments, such as re-randomization, non-responder discontinuation or dose adjustment.
