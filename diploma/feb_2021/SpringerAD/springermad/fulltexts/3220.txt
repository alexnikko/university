Introduction
Till date, the use of talc has been widely made as an inert and inexpensive diluent by pharmaceutical industry. Restricted to microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) has been used as a globally approved pellet excipient; rather, MCC is a golden standard in pellet making [ ]. However, the interaction of MCC with the ranitidine has questioned its chemical inertness [ ]. Simultaneously, difficulty in disintegration and significant adsorption of ketotifen, famotidine, amoxicillin, ampicilline, fluphenazine dihydrochloride and promethazine hydrochloride, and so on [ , , ] have also reported. Consequently, posing difficulty in the release of poorly soluble drugs from MCC pellets [ ]. To overcome these problems, pectinic acid [ , , , , , ], chitosan [ , , ], κ-carrageenan [ , , , ], xanthan gum [ ], waxy corn starch [ , ], lactose [ ], glyceryl monostearate [ ], and so on have been investigated. Basic reason why the search for new pellet excipient has been triggered lies in its physicochemical interactions with actives, processing difficulties, and poor technological performance (processability, sphericity, flowability, crushing resistance, etc.) [ ].
To overcome these shortcomings, search for new excipient was initiated, and we thought to carry out extrusion-spheronization (ES) of talc and investigate its performance. Literature has revealed physicochemical and physiological inertness of talc and its widespread use as a pharmaceutical excipient and inert diluents [ ]. The use of talc as placebo granules has been attempted by Lin and Peck and Ho and Hersey [ , ], but the strength of the granules was poor. Recently, Kadam et al. [ , ] used talc as a diluent in crystallo-co-agglomeration (CCA) technique for size enlargement of solids. Simultaneously, we have reported the use of talc in design of bromhexine hydrochloridetalc agglomerates prepared by CCA and noted deformable nature of agglomerates [ ]. And, interestingly, poor adsorption of bromhexine hydrochloride on talc has been noted [ ]. Study carried out by Ganjian et al. has shown least adsorption of cimetidine on talc compared to kaolin, activated charcoal, and magnesium trisilicate [ ]. Similar findings related with deformation of ibuprofen-talc agglomerates have been reported by Pawar et al. [ ]. Recently, talc beads prepared by wet spherical agglomeration have been reported as substrate for coating. Although the beads showed satisfactory crushing resistance, technique uses organic solvent and poses difficulty in scaling up.
In the present work, talc pellets were prepared by ES technique using MCC as a pelletisation aid. A 3 2 factorial design was used to optimize the pelletisation of talc. Talc and MCC were used as independent variables, and pellets obtained were compared with MCC pellets prepared by same ES technique. Both pellets were evaluated for surface morphology, sphericity, micromeritic, mechanical, and compressional properties. Further, pellets were functionalized by layering with felodipine and application of surelease NG coat. At the conclusion, the surface and drug release characteristics of both coated talc and MCC coated were subjected to comparison.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Talc was purchased from Loba chemie (Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), and MCC was gift sample from Accent microcell Pvt. Ltd (Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India). Felodipine was a kind of gift from Cipla Ltd. (Patalganga, Maharashtra, India). Surelease NG was supplied by Colorcon Asia Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, Maharashtra, and Mumbai). Rest chemicals were purchased locally.
Method
Fabrication and Evaluation of Talc Pellets
A 3 2 factorial design was implemented to study extrusion-spheronisation of talc. The amount of talc (X 1 ) and MCC ( X 2 ), studied at three levels, was selected as independent variables, and a total of nine batches of pellets (TP1-TP9) were obtained. A statistical model incorporating interactive and polynomial terms was used to calculate the responses [ ]. $$ \mathrm{Y}={\upbeta}_0+{\upbeta}_1{\mathrm{X}}_1+{\upbeta}_2{\mathrm{X}}_2+{\upbeta}_{12}{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_2+{\upbeta}_{11}{\mathrm{X}}_1{\mathrm{X}}_1+{\upbeta}_{22}{\mathrm{X}}_2{\mathrm{X}}_2 $$ (1)
Where Y is the response variable, β 0 is the arithmetic mean response of the nine batches, and β 1 , β 2 , β 11 , β 12 , and β 22 are the estimated coefficients for the corresponding factors X 1 , X 2 , X 11 , X 12 , and X 22 , respectively, which represents the average result of changing one factor at a time from its low-to-high value. The interaction term (X 1 X 2 ) shows how the response changes when two factors are simultaneously changed. The polynomial terms (X 1 X 1 and X 2 X 2 ) are included to investigate nonlinearity. The levels of independent variable used in 3 2 factorial design have been given in Table 1 . Table 1 Composition of talc pellets prepared by ES technique: 3 2 factorial design Batch code Talc (X1) gm (level) MCC ( X 2) gm (level) Total weight (gm) TP1 18 (+1) 2 (−1) 20 TP2 16 (0) 2 (−1) 18 TP3 14 (−1) 2 (−1) 16 TP4 18 (+1) 4 (0) 22 TP5 16 (0) 4 (0) 20 TP6 14 (−1) 4 (0) 18 TP7 18 (+1) 6 (+1) 24 TP8 16 (0) 6 (+1) 22 TP9 14 (−1) 6 (+1) 20
In ES of talc, to homogenous powder mixture of talc and MCC, deionised water (10–12 ml, for each batch) was added to get the wet mass, which was further subjected to extrusion for getting cylindrical extrudates. Subsequently, wet extrudates were fed to spheronizer (NAOMI®), for 5–10 min, at 500 rpm and uniform size spherical pellets were obtained. In the next step, these wet pellets were subjected to drying in oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Similarly, process was adopted for preparation of MCC pellets (MP0) and used for comparison with talc pellets (TP). The major mesh fraction of TP, #20/30 (ASTM), having average diameter of 747 μm was subjected to comparison with MP0.
Yield
Pellet yield was calculated on the basis of total weight of pellets obtained after drying and initial weight of talc and MCC for TP1–TP9. Same procedure was adopted for the calculation of yield for plain MCC pellets [ , ].
Topology
The surface characters of uncoated and coated TP9 and MP0 pellets were studied from microphotographs taken by scanning electron microscope (Jeol, JSM 6360, Japan) at magnification of 50× and 500×. Initially, pellets were coated with gold in an argon atmosphere by an ion sputter coater (Jeol, JSM 1260, Japan).
Particle Size Distribution
Particle size distribution of pellets was carried out by mesh analysis (Ro-Tap sieve shaker, Labtronics, Haryana, India) using mesh fractions (ASTM) 16/18, 18/20, 20/30, 30/44, and 44/60. Twenty grams of pellets, TP1–TP9 and MP0, were separately subjected to sieving, and the shaker was tapped for 5 min. Pellets retained on each mesh were weighed, and the resulting data were used to obtain the mean geometric diameter by plotting cumulative percentage undersize versus the average particle size on log probability paper. Study was performed in triplicate for each batch of pellets [ ].
Shape and Sphericity Determination
Randomly selected ten pellets, TP1–TP9 and MP0, were photomicrographed separately using digital microscope (Motic microscopes) and used for shape and sphericity determination. The particle shape and sphericity of both TP and MP0 pellets were measured by computing aspect ratio (AR), circularity factor (CF), roundness factor (RF), and shape factor (SF), as per the formulae given below [ , ]. $$ \mathrm{AR}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}\right) $$ (2) $$ \mathrm{CF}=\frac{\pi {\left(\mathrm{major}\;\mathrm{axis}\right)}^2}{4\times \mathrm{area}} $$ (3) $$ \mathrm{RF}=\frac{{\left(\mathrm{P}\right)}^2}{12.56\times \mathrm{area}} $$ (4) $$ \mathrm{SF}=\frac{{\left(\mathrm{P}\hbox{'}\hbox{'}\right)}^2}{\mathrm{P}\hbox{'}} $$ (5)
Where \( \mathrm{P}\hbox{'}\hbox{'}=2\pi \frac{{\left(\mathrm{A}\right)}^{{\scriptscriptstyle \raisebox{1ex}{$1$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$2$}\right.}}}{\pi } \)
Flowability Measurement
Flowability of TP1–TP9 and MP0 pellets was assessed by the angle of repose determined using fixed funnel free standing cone method in triplicate $$ \uptheta ={ \tan}^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathrm{H}}{\mathrm{R}}\right) $$ (6)
Where ‘θ’ is the angle of repose; ‘H’ is the height between lower tip of the funnel and heap base of pellets; and ‘R’ is the radius of the heap base formed.
However, Carr’s compressibility index (CCI) was calculated for both TP1–TP9 and MP0, from bulk and tapped density values (bulk density apparatus, Lab Hosp, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India) [ , ]. $$ \mathrm{CCI}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{TD}\kern0.5em \hbox{-} \kern0.5em \mathrm{BD}\right)}{\mathrm{TD}}\times 100 $$ (7)
The volume of pellets measured before and after tapping was used to plot the graph of number of tappings ( n ) versus the degree of volume reduction (n/c). The constants ‘a’ and ‘b’ were calculated from slope and ‘y’ intercept using Kawakita equation [ ]. $$ \frac{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{a}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{a}\mathrm{b}} $$ (8)
Where C is void volume reduction, \( \mathrm{C}=\frac{{\mathrm{V}}_0\hbox{-} \mathrm{V}\infty }{{\mathrm{V}}_0} \) ;
Vo, initial volume of pellets; V∞, pellet volume after tapping.
Mechanical Properties
The crushing strength (CS) of pellets was measured by using ‘mercury load cell method’. Twenty pellets from each, TP1–TP9 and MP0, were subjected to measurement of CS using hypodermic syringe modified in such a way that the tip of the barrel and the closed end of the plunger at rear side has been removed. Mercury was poured from reservoir into the plunger at the rate of 10 g/s, until the pellet kept below plunger was crushed. The total weight of the plunger and the mercury required to crush the pellet was considered as CS [ ].
For friability studies, 10 g of pellets from each batch (TP1–TP9) and MP0 were taken separately and subjected to attrition in ball mill for 30 min at 25 rpm. The amount of fines passing through mesh number 60 (ASTM) was used for the calculation of percentage fines. And the results obtained have been expressed in terms of the percentage friability [ , , , ]. $$ \%\;\mathrm{Weight}\ \mathrm{loss} = \frac{\mathrm{W}0\;\hbox{-}\;\mathrm{Wt}}{\mathrm{W}0}\times 100 $$ (9)
Moisture Content
The moisture content of pellets TP9 and MP0 was determined using IR moisture balance (Rajdhani, Mumbai, India) at 105 °C for 4 h. The percent weight reduction due to moisture loss was directly displayed on the scale [ , ].
Disintegration Test
One hundred grams of pellets from each batch, TP1–TP9 and MP0, were subjected to disintegration in tablet disintegration test apparatus using water as a disintegration media. Mechanical agitation was provided with disc. The disintegration time was noted by visual observation of disintegrated fines passing through the bottom mesh (250 μm), into surrounding elution medium [ ].
Drug Layering and Polymer Coat Application
From batches TP1–TP9, pellets of batch TP9 were selected as a substrate for coating due to its maximum crushing resistance and acceptable flowability. Exactly, weighed 1.66 g of finely micronized felodipine (10 mg/300 mg talc pellets) was uniformly dispersed in aqueous PVP K-30 dispersion (3 % w/v , 50 ml) and sprayed/layered using spray gun (Labultima, Mumbai, India) at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, on 50 g of either pellets (TP9 and MP0) loaded in a coating pan (Space Lab, Nasik, Maharashtra, India). Subsequently, polymer base coat, HPMC 5 cps (2.5 % w/v ), was sprayed on drug-loaded core at 58 ± 2 °C for 3 % weight gain followed by coat of Surelease NG, an aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose (15 % w/v ) for 15 % weight gain [ , ].
Drug Content
Weighed quantity (5 g) of intact coated TP9 and MP0 pellets was separately powdered, and powder equivalent to 10 mg of felodipine was transferred to 50 ml volumetric flask containing 30 ml of methanol to make up volume to 50 ml. The absorbance of resulting solution was measured at λ max 238 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer, and drug content was determined from the values of regression coefficients (slope, 0.04033; constant, −0.0274) obtained from standard curve [ ].
In vitro Drug Release Studies
Exactly weighed, 300 ± 3 mg of intact coated pellets TP9 and MP0 were separately taken and subjected to dissolution studies in United States Pharmacopoeia type II dissolution test apparatus (TDT 08 L, Electrolab, Mumbai, India). The study was carried out for first 2 h in 900 mL of 0.1 N HCl followed by 900 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at 37 ± 0.5 °C and speed of paddles 100 rpm. At predefined time intervals, 5 mL of aliquot was withdrawn and drug content was analysed spectrophotometrically (Jasco V-530, UV spectrophotometer) at λ max 238 nm and the data were subjected to PCP Disso V 2.08 (Poona College of Pharmacy, Pune, Maharashtra, India) for drug release kinetic studies [ , ].
Results and Discussion
For ES process, excipients should have large surface area and good water absorption and holding capacity. But, the talc, although has a huge surface area, being hydrophobic, had poor water affinity. Hence, incorporation of minimum amount of MCC as a pelletisation aid to talc during pelletisation was attempted.
Hence, MCC was added which is golden standard for the ES process, and it was possible to use the water as wet massing liquid. So, in this process of ES, the MCC was added in varying amount to the talc, water was used as wet massing liquid. Further wet mass was subjected to extrusion and fed to spheronizer. Spheronization was carried out for 5 min at 500 rpm. Pellets obtained were subjected to air drying.
Before optimization, many trials have been carried out for the selection of accessories like extrusion screen (1 mm), spheronization plate having 3-mm-size groves. After the selection of accessories, many trials have been carried out. It has been observed that it was too critical to select extruder screen and spheronization plate because these are main parameter which decides size of the pellets. Then another critical part was to adjust water level, spheronization revolution per minute, and spheronization time. Trial batches of 20 g size were taken at initially for batch containing 16 g of talc and 4 g of MCC, and 25 ml water was added but batch was failed due to excess water. Large size pellets has been formed. Material with enough water level spheronized successfully. Total water content of material decides the spheronization effectively.
Yield
Percentage yield was calculated on the basis of total weight of pellets obtained after drying. For all the batches, the % yield was in the range of 41.6–86.55 % w/w . From Table 1 , it has been seen that talc reduced the % yield of pellets whereas MCC increased the % yield. The maximum yield was obtained at lowest level of talc and highest level of MCC. Regression coefficients showed the predominant negative effect of talc (β 1 = −5.875) whereas there was predominant positive effect of MCC (β 2 = 12.800). MCC showed a significant effect ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed for TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).

Particle Size Distribution
For acceptable film coating, a narrow size distribution of pellets is a prerequisite (in addition to spherical shape and smooth surface). The size distribution affects both the performance of the coating and the rate of the drug. A narrow size distribution will ensure minimum variation in coating thickness throughout the batch of pellets and therefore result in a uniform performance of pellets within the batch. A narrow particle size-distribution improves (facilitates) the blending process in blending different types of pellets or different batches of pellets. From the plot of particle size distribution (Fig. 3 ), values of mean geometric diameter (MGD) in micrometer have been obtained by extrapolating the curve, and the obtained values of MGD have been used for further regression analysis study. In present study, MGD was in the range of 708.04 ± 6.28 to 791.73 ± 1.02 μm.

Shape and Sphericity Determination
Aspect Ratio
For aspect ratio, Chopra (2002) has given AR (1.20) as an acceptability limiting value for capsule filling. Except TP1 and TP-2, all batches showed AR within limit (1.02 ± 0.04 to 1.12 ± 0.11). From response surface plot, it has been observed that by increasing concentration of talc aspect ratio increased. At intermediate level of both talc and MCC, aspect ratio remained in limit of <1.2. From regression coefficients, it has been revealed that MCC showed predominant negative effect on aspect ratio (β 2 = −0.080). Both factors in combinations showed the predominant negative effect (β 12 = −0.075). Insignificant difference has been observed at ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).
Circularity Factor
The CF was in the range of 1.003 to 1.0048. The batch TP9 showed circularity (1.0004 ± 0.000252) close to unity same as that of the MP0 pellets. Talc at its higher level showed CF away from unity. Table 2 showed that MCC increased CF of talc pellets with increase in its concentration. MCC showed predominant negative effect (β 2 = −0.002). Significant effect has been observed for MCC ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).

Shape Factor
The SF of talc pellets was in the range of 0.848 to 0.999 similar as that of MP0 pellets. Batch TP6 and TP9 containing more percentage of MCC showed SF of 0.999. Here, MCC has contributed to sphericity. An insignificant difference was found between the SF of TP9 and MP0 pellets ( P > 0.05). Regression coefficient showed predominant negative effect of talc on shape factor (β 1 = −0.024). MCC showed a significant effect ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).
Roundness Factor
In the present work, all batches except TP1 showed RF (1.0003 to 1.0682) which is identical to MP0 pellets. An insignificant difference was found between the RF of talc and MCC pellets. MCC at extreme level showed roundness near to unity whereas batches containing more amount of talc showed roundness away from unity. Table 2 showed predominant negative effect of MCC (β 2 = −0.059) and in combination with talc (β 12 = −0.090). The insignificant effect of both talc and MCC on RF was observed within all batches at P > 0.05. Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).
Flowability Measurement
The angle of repose for all batches was found in the range of 25° to 30° which indicated good flowability of pellets, as Lalla et al. (1995) have reported an angle of repose for spheronized product in the range of 25° to 30°. In the present study, the angle of repose was found to be increased with increase in talc. As seen earlier, increase in MCC at high level increased sphericity of pellet and hence the flowability of pellet might have improved. From regression coefficients, MCC showed predominant negative effect (β 2 = −0.928) on the angle of repose for all batches TP1–TP9. MCC showed a significant effect ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).
CCI of 5–15 indicates excellent flowability. In the present study, CCI was found to be in the range of 8–13 which showed excellent flowability of talc pellets. CCI was found maximum at highest content of talc while MCC did not show any significant effect on CCI. At extreme level of MCC, CCI increased but less as compared to talc. Regression coefficients have shown the predominant positive effect of MCC on CCI (β 2 = 0.953) and HR (β 2 = 0.011). An insignificant effect on CCI of all batches has been observed ( P < 0.05). Insignificant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P > 0.05).
From the equation of Kawakita plot, two constants were obtained, constant ‘a’ and ‘b’. The ‘a’ value was in the range of 0.1595 ± 0.0005 to 0.2620 ± 0.0011. The ‘b’ value was in the range of 0.1165 ± 0.0004 to 0.2605 ± 0.0004. The ‘a’ value indicates total reduction in volume of pellets bed and ‘b’ value is inversely proportional to yield strength of pellets. In the present study, the ‘a’ value is more than ‘b’ in all batches except TP1, TP2, and TP7 indicating good flowability but considering packability of granules; the ‘a’ value should be more than ‘b’. The good packability was observed in batches containing more content of MCC. Regression coefficients showed predominant negative effect of both talc (β 1 = −0.019) and MCC (β 2 = −0.005). An insignificant effect on ‘a’ value of Kawakita plot of all batches has been observed ( P > 0.05). In combination, predominant positive effect has been observed (β 12 = 0.016). The ‘b’ value was found maximum at highest content of MCC and lowest content of talc (TP9). An insignificant effect on ‘b’ value of Kawakita plot of all batches has been observed ( P > 0.05). Significant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P < 0.05).
Mechanical Properties
For the purpose of coating, pellets should withstand the pressure. In present study, the crushing strength was in the range of 35.57 to 326.69 g. The CS was increased with increase in MCC. This might be due to entire entrapment of MCC within talc pellets. CS of talc pellets was decreased with increase in talc content. Response surface showed (Fig. 4 ) that CS of talc pellets was maximum at extreme level of MCC and minimum at extreme level of talc. From regression coefficients, it can be seen that MCC had predominant positive effect (β 2 = 101.82) and talc showed a predominant negative effect (β 1 = −32.17) on CS. Significant effect of MCC on all batches has been observed ( P < 0.05). Significant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P < 0.05). Fig. 4 Response surface plot of crushing strength (CS) versus TALC and MCC content
In the present study, friability of MP0 pellets was found to be least because of hard nature of MCC pellets while soft nature of talc pellets led to shading of loosely bonded talc particles from its surface. Percentage weight loss from talc pellets was found to be decreased with increase in MCC content and increased in talc content. MCC decreased % weight loss due to increased bonding between talc particles. The minimal % weight loss which was desired was seen at lowest talc content and highest MCC content. Table 3 showed predominant positive effect of talc (β 1 = 0.072) and predominant negative effect of MCC (β 2 = −0.026). The significant effect of MCC on friability (% weight loss) of all batches has been observed ( P < 0.05). Significant difference has been observed within batches TP9 and MP0 pellets at ( P < 0.05).

Moisture Content
The moisture content of pellet is an important parameter deciding the stability of moisture sensitive actives. The moisture content of representative batch of talc pellets (TM9) coated MCC pellets after drying was found to be 0.137 ± 0.094 and 0.513 ± 0.109 %.
Disintegration Test
Disintegration of pellets is important parameter to study the effect of binder and the release of actives from the pellets. In present study, disintegration time was in the range of the 3.75 ± 0.35 to 42.4.5 ± 0.70. Highest disintegration time was observed in batch TP9. At extreme level of MCC, disintegration time was maximum whereas at higher level of talc disintegration time minimum. Regression coefficient showed predominant negative effect of talc (β 1 = −4.208). In combination, predominant positive effect has been observed (β 12 = 3.063). MCC showed significant effect ( P < 0.05). Significant difference has been observed in batch TP9 and MP0 pellets ( P < 0.05).
Drug Content
The drug content of TP9 and MP0 batch was found to be 94.86 ± 1.34 and 92.96 ± 2.79 %, respectively. This was within the limit given by British Pharmacopoeia (90–110 %) for felodipine tablet.
In vitro Drug Release Studies
Form the in vitro drug release profile (Fig. 5 ), it can be seen that TP9 and MP0 formulation showed almost similar drug release profile. In the first 2 h of drug release study (0.1 N HCl), TP9 released about 29 ± 2.3 % of drug while 28.2 ± 2.4 % of drug was released from MP0, respectively, and after the end of 8 h, TP9 and MP0 pellets showed 95.58 ± 0.98.2 and 92.63 ± 3.08 % drug release, respectively. This increase in % drug release was because of more surface area of pellet exposed to dissolution medium. Both the formulations followed first-order release profile throughout the entire study. Also, it can be seen that drug release could be sustained from TP9 and MP0 pellets by increasing the thickness of functional coat of polymer. From similarity factor, it has been observed that all batches, TP9 and MP0 batches, showed a good similarity (f 2 factor 74.53).

Conclusion
Extrusion-spheronisation of talc was successfully carried out by using MCC as a pelletisation aid. Pellets having satisfactory sphericity, angle of repose, aspect ratio <1.20, Carr’s compressibility index, and optimum Kawakita constants indicating excellent flow properties were obtained. Topological examination, micromeritics, and drug and/or polymer loading capacity have revealed talc pellets comparable with MCC pellets. However, an interesting observation was noted during disintegration of pellets. At extreme level of MCC, disintegration time was highest, whereas, at higher level of talc, disintegration time was lowest. Predominant negative effect of talc on disintegration time was found contributing. The drug release studies showed that functionalized talc and MCC pellets followed extended first-order kinetics. From the study, it can be concluded that talc pellets prepared by extrusion-spheronisation technique, due to its physicochemical and physiological inertness, poor drug adsorption, and rapid disintegration, can be used instead of MCC pellets.
