Introduction
Pharmaceutical tablets are frequently formed with debossed surface features (Fig. 1 ) in order to identify the product, and in some cases, to facilitate tablet splitting with scoring [ , ]. Debossing is one of the preferred methods for imprinting tablets since debossing can be easily incorporated into the manufacturing process by embossing the punches used to create the tablets. Fig. 1 An example of debossed tablets with picking on the two upper debossed circles of the tablet on the right side of the figure
Common problems faced when debossing include picking, illegible features, and stress concentrations that can lead to tablet fracture. Picking occurs when tablet material sticks to the embossed punch surface, resulting in missing regions of the features [ , , ]. Feature illegibility may result from poorly designed tooling or significant post-compaction elastic rebound of the tablet [ ]. Stress concentrations occur at concave debossed features such as interior corners and valleys, and if the radii of curvature are too small for a given tablet formulation and loading environment, then fracture of the compact can occur [ , ].
The Tablet Specification Manual of the American Pharmaceutical Association [ ] provides recommendations, presumably found through experience, to reduce some of the problems associated with tablet debossing. These include keeping the stroke angle, i.e., the angle of the debossed valley walls with respect to the vertical, within a specified range, making the area of confined features, such as the interior regions of an “A” or “8” as large as possible, and avoiding sharp corners, such as those found on the letters “W” and “Y.” There has been little modeling work, however, to provide specific quantitative recommendations depending on tablet formulation or specific feature designs.
Numerous studies have examined sticking on tablet punches, which is when the material adheres to the punch away from debossed features, with fewer studies examining picking. Most of these investigations are empirical and have focused on how punch tip coatings influence picking and sticking [ , , ], including the influence of surface roughness [ ]. Tsiftsoglou and Mendes [ ] found that coated tools required smaller ejection forces, and consequently, sticking propensity to the tooling was reduced. Schumann and Searle [ ] concluded that chromium nitride ion bombardment treatment of the punch surface eliminated sticking behavior. However, Roberts et al. [ ] showed that chrome plating the punch tip did not alleviate picking and sticking problems and smoother punch surfaces did not necessarily correspond to a reduction in sticking.
Waimer et al. [ ] and Mullarney et al. [ ] studied the influence of adhesion between a tablet and punch during powder compaction. They found that sticking was sensitive to the compaction behavior of the formulation components, compaction force, and surface finish of the punches. Mullarney et al. showed that addition of magnesium stearate in limited quantities reduced sticking behavior. However, addition of magnesium stearate to a formulation containing mannitol exacerbated sticking. Increasing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) percentage worsened sticking behavior.
Waimer et al. [ ] investigated the influence of engraving features using small conical debossing “shear cones” on the punch’s surface (Fig. 2 ). This study showed that the shear cones on the punch face modified the shear stress distribution within the tablet. Increasing the shear cone angle ε, corresponding to decreasing the stroke angle, resulted in decreasing adhesion forces. Fig. 2 Schematic of a shear cone used by Waimer et al. [ ]. The angle of the shear cone is ε
Laity [ ] studied the effect of embossed punch features on the compaction behavior of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Cylindrical compacts were produced with single and double furrows (Fig. 3 ) across the compact’s top face. Using a small angle x-ray scattering technique, this study demonstrated that large changes in relative density occur in the vicinity of the furrows, with smaller relative densities near the furrow’s flanks and larger relative densities at the furrow base. In addition, smaller density regions around the furrows were prone to cracking and flaking, especially in the region between the double furrows. Fig. 3 Schematic of the cylindrical MCC compacts produced by Laity [ ]. a A compact with a single furrow across the compact’s top face. b A compact with a double furrow
The present work focuses on modeling the local elasto-plastic response of material in the vicinity of a debossed feature. Specifically, the degree of post-compaction material rebound is predicted along with the relative density, i.e., solid fraction, field as changes are made to the debossed feature geometry and material formulation. The methodology presented in this paper is the first step in developing a fully predictive model for investigating the manufacture of debossed features.
Background
In this section, a review of the finite element method (FEM) using the modified Drucker–Prager Cap (DPC) constitutive model is provided, followed by the methodology used to calibrate the DPC model parameters. These topics are presented since the modeling work in this paper relies on FEM using the modified DPC model.
Finite Element Method Modeling of Tablet Compaction
The FEM is a well-developed numerical technique (e.g., [ ]) that has been used recently to model powder compaction processes [ , , , , , , ]. These studies have examined the influence of equipment design and product formulation on various aspects of manufacturing operations such as relative density, i.e., solid fraction, and boundary and internal stress distributions. Comparisons of FEM model predictions to experimental measurements have shown that with proper material characterization and well-defined boundary conditions, the technique can produce accurate predictions (e.g., [ , ]).
The Drucker–Prager Cap Constitutive Model
Fundamental to the FEM method is the constitutive model relating the applied traction to the resulting stress and strain (and/or strain rates) for the material being modeled. A number of critical state models have been proposed to describe the densification behavior of powder, such as those proposed by Drucker [ ], Schofield [ ], Green [ ], DiMaggio and Sandler [ ], and Gurson [ ]. The term “critical state” refers to the response of the material while it is yielding. The early models included only yielding due to material densification. The Drucker–Prager Cap (DPC) model [ , ] improved upon these prior models by including shearing behavior in addition to densification. A further improvement to the DPC model, known as the modified DPC model, includes the dependence of the DPC yielding behavior on the powder’s instantaneous relative density [ ]. It is the DPC and modified DPC models that are most frequently used for modeling pharmaceutical powder compaction. Comprehensive reviews of the models are provided in Cunningham et al. [ ], Han et al. [ ], and Shang et al. [ ]. For the reader’s convenience, however, a review of the modified DPC model is presented here since this is the model used in the present work. In addition, the experimental procedures used to determine the model parameters are also presented. Note that the current FEM and DPC models do not include a fracture model.
The DPC model’s yield functions and flow rules are functions of two stress invariants: the hydrostatic stress, p , and the Mises equivalent stress, q . The hydrostatic stress is defined as the trace of the stress tensor σ ij , $$ p=-\frac{1}{3}{\sigma}_{ii}. $$ (1) The Mises equivalent stress is proportional to the magnitude of the inner product of the deviatoric stress tensor, S ij = σ ij − pδ ij , where the quantity δ ij is the Dirac delta operator, $$ q=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}{S}_{ij}{S}_{ij}}. $$ (2) The DPC model’s yield functions appear as three curves in the p – q plane: a shear line F s , an elliptical cap F c , and a transition curve F t . Each of these curves is described in the following paragraphs and is depicted graphically in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 A plot illustrating the DPC yield envelopes at a fixed relative density. Note that for the modified DPC model, yield envelopes can shift for each relative density
The shear yield line is described by the powder compact’s cohesion d and internal friction angle β according to the relation, $$ {F}_s\left(p,q\right)=q-p \tan \beta -d=0. $$ (3) An applied stress state located below the line results in only elastic distortion of the powder compact. A stress state located on the shear yield line indicates volumetric dilation and fracture of the powder compact. Note that for the modified DPC model, the values for d and β may change, depending on the powder compact’s instantaneous relative density.
The elliptical cap F c is given in the DPC model as, $$ {F}_c\left(p,q\right)={\left[{\left(p-{p}_a\right)}^2+{\left(\frac{Rq}{1+\alpha +\raisebox{1ex}{$\alpha $}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$ \cos \beta $}\right.}\right)}^2\right]}^{\raisebox{1ex}{$1$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$2$}\right.}-R\left(d+{p}_a \tan \beta \right)=0, $$ (4) where p a is known as the stress evolution parameter, R is the eccentricity, or aspect ratio, of the elliptical cap, and α (0.05 ≤ α ≤ 0.1) is a constant used to smoothly transition between the cap and the transition curve, which is discussed in the following paragraph. A stress state falling on the cap represents densification of the powder.
The transition curve F t is included in numerical implementations of the DPC model in order to provide numerical stability when stress states transition between the cap and shear envelopes. This transition curve is given by, $$ {F}_t\left(p,q\right)={\left\{{\left(p-{p}_a\right)}^2+\left[q-\left(1-\frac{\alpha }{ \cos \beta}\right){\left(d+{p}_a \tan \beta \right)}^2\right]\right\}}^{\raisebox{1ex}{$1$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$2$}\right.}-\alpha \left(d+{p}_a \tan \beta \right)=0. $$ (5) The curves F s , F c , and F t only identify when yielding of the material occurs; they do not provide information on the powder’s resulting deformation. This information is described in terms of material (differential) strains, $$ d{\varepsilon}_{ij}=d{\varepsilon}_{ij}^e+d{\varepsilon}_{ij}^p, $$ (6) where ε ij is the total strain, ε ij e is the (recoverable) elastic strain, and ε ij p is the (unrecoverable) plastic strain. The elastic strain is given by, $$ d{\varepsilon}_{ij}^e=\frac{\left(1-\nu \right)}{E}d{\sigma}_{ij}-\frac{\nu }{E}d{\sigma}_{kk}{\delta}_{ij}, $$ (7) where linearly elastic, isotropic material behavior is assumed, with E and ν being the material’s elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio, respectively.
The plastic strain is calculated using a plastic potential g , defined such that, $$ d{\varepsilon}_{ij}^p=d\lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial {\sigma}_{ij}}, $$ (8) where dλ is a stress increment dependent positive scalar [ ]. In the DPC model, it is assumed and shown experimentally by Sinka et al. [ ] that a normality condition holds on the cap and transition yield curves, known as “associated flow,” such that at the cap curve, $$ g={F}_c\left(p,q\right), $$ (9) and at the transition curve, $$ g={F}_t\left(p,\ q\right). $$ (10) The associated flow rule relates the radial and axial strains and stresses during tablet compaction to the slope of the elliptical cap in Fig. 3 . On the shearing line, however, the flow is assumed to be non-associative ( g ≠ F s ( p , q )). On this line, the plastic potential is given by, $$ g={\left\{{\left[\left(p-{p}_a\right) \tan \beta \right]}^2+{q}^2\right\}}^{\raisebox{1ex}{$1$}\!\left/ \!\raisebox{-1ex}{$2$}\right.}. $$ (11) The strains on the shear yield line use this plastic flow potential in conjunction with Eq. 8 .
Equations ( 3 )–( 7 ) show that the use of the DPC model requires knowledge of seven parameters: d , β , p a , R , α , E , and ν . The transition constant α is typically set arbitrarily to a value in the range 0.05 ≤ α ≤ 0.1 so that the numerical computations are stable. Thus, there are actually only six parameters that must be determined through material characterization experiments. For the modified DPC model, these six parameters must be determined as a function of the relative density. The following section provides the theoretical foundation for how the six parameters are determined from three independent tests, each performed as a function of powder compact relative density.
DPC Parameter Calibration
The mechanical tests used to determine DPC parameters were performed on cylindrical compacts produced using a uniaxial punch and die system installed on a universal material testing machine (MTS model C43.504). A computer-aided design (CAD) model of the system is shown in Fig. 5a . A 10-mm diameter, 22.2-mm-tall die was used with flat-faced upper and lower punches. The lower punch remained fixed throughout the experiments. Load cells (MTS model 661.20F-03; Interface model LBM-50K) were mounted on the punches to record upper and lower uniaxial compression forces. A servo encoder on the MTS measured the upper punch’s axial displacement. A piezoelectric pressure sensor (Kistler, model 6183) was installed radially in the die so that its tip made direct contact with the powder in order to measure the radial stress during compression of the compacts. The lower punch location was adjusted so the pressure sensor was located approximately at the mid-height of the compacts at maximum compression (Fig. 5b ). The die walls and punch faces were coated with a thin layer of magnesium stearate prior to all compact manufacturing and testing steps in order to approximate frictionless boundary surfaces. This coating was produced by compressing and discarding a slug of magnesium stearate before every compaction run. All compacts were produced at a loading and unloading strain rate of approximately 5 mm/min in order to maintain quasi-static loading conditions. The dwell time was zero in all cases. The MTS TestWorks software and an NI BNC-2110 data acquisition board were used to acquire sensor data at a rate of 1,000 Hz. Fig. 5 a A schematic of the punch and die system used to create and test powder compacts used for material characterization. b A schematic showing the location of the radial pressure sensor
Changes in relative humidity have been shown to have an influence on powder properties [ , ]. The measurements performed in these studies were performed in typical room conditions. Measurements of the room temperature showed that it varied by 5.2 °C (17.6–22.8 °C) while the relative humidity varied 14 % (45 % RH to 59 % RH). The influence of humidity on powder properties is very powder specific. For both mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose, increasing the moisture content in the powder increases the cohesion and friction angle of the powders [ , ].
Determination of the six DPC parameters at a single relative density involved three tests. The first two were used to measure a compact’s strength, from which the shear yield parameters d (cohesion) and β (internal friction angle) were obtained. The third test was a confined uniaxial compression test, in which the axial and radial stresses were measured as a function of axial strain during both compression and decompression of the powder. Data obtained from this third test were used to obtain the elliptical cap surface parameters R (cap eccentricity) and p a (stress evolution parameter), as well as the elastic parameters E (elastic modulus) and ν (Poisson’s ratio). Since the modified DPC model parameters vary with the relative density, the three tests were performed over the range of relative densities expected in the FEM simulations, which in the present case ranges from 0.3 to 0.95. The theory and procedures for calculating these parameters from measured data are described in the following paragraphs.
The shear line parameters d and β at a given relative density were found using a method adapted from Procopio [ ]. Two cylindrical compacts at the same post-ejection relative density were produced. The two compacts had different aspect ratios: D / h > 1 and D / h < 1, where D was the compact diameter and h was its height. In the present work, 1,100 mg of powder was used to produce a large aspect ratio compact while 250 mg of powder was used to create a smaller aspect ratio compact. Both compacts were loaded until failure, with the D / h > 1 compact loaded uniaxially and the D / h < 1 compact loaded diametrically using curved platens (Fig. 6 ). The loading rate during these compact failure tests was maintained at 5 mm/min, identical to the rate used to create the compacts. Because the aspect ratios of the compacts vary, there is the potential for bias in the measurements. However, care was taken to ensure the uniaxial test sample aspect ratios were greater than one and the aspect ratios for the diametrical test samples were less than one, as assumed in the theoretical analysis models. Note that these loading tests were performed soon after the creation of the compact in order to avoid significant post-compaction changes in compact relative density due to creep. Caliper measurements of the compact dimensions showed that little post-compaction deformation occurred between compact creation and failure testing. Fig. 6 Photographs from ( a ) a diametrical compression failure test for a D / h > 1 compact and ( b ) a uniaxial compression failure test for a D / h < 1 compact
For uniaxial compression, given by the subscript “ u ,” the hydrostatic stress p u and Mises stress q u at failure are, $$ {p}_u=\frac{1}{3}{\sigma}_u, $$ (12) $$ {q}_u=-{\sigma}_u $$ (13) where, $$ {\sigma}_u=\frac{4{F}_u}{\pi {D}^2}, $$ (14) is the stress in the uniaxial direction. The parameter F u is the uniaxial load at failure. For the diametrical loading case, given by the subscript “ d ,” the stress state is a modified Hertz solution for curved anvils proposed by Awaji and Sato [ ], $$ \begin{array}{l}{p}_d=\frac{2}{3}{\sigma}_d\\ {}{q}_d=\sqrt{13}{\sigma}_d,\end{array} $$ (15) $$ {q}_d=\sqrt{13}{\sigma}_d, $$ (16) assuming D / h > 1, where, $$ {\sigma}_d=\left\{1-1.15{\left(\frac{b}{R}\right)}^2+0.22{\left(\frac{b}{R}\right)}^3\right\}\frac{2{F}_d}{\pi Dt}, $$ (17) is the stress at the failure location (at the tablet’s center). The parameter F d is the applied diametrical force at failure, t is the compact thickness, b is the contact half width, and R is the radius of the anvils.
As shown in Procopio [ ], both ( p u , q u ) and ( p d , q d ) lie on the shear yield line. Using these parameters, the powder cohesion d and internal friction angle β can be expressed as, $$ d=\frac{\sigma_u{\sigma}_d\left(\sqrt{13}-2\right)}{\sigma_u-2{\sigma}_d}, $$ (18) and, $$ \beta ={ \tan}^{-1}\left[\frac{3\left({\sigma}_u-d\right)}{\sigma_u}\right]. $$ (19) Note that although uniaxial and diametrical compression tests were performed in the current work, other tests could also have been used to provide the shear yield line parameters. For example, the cohesion and internal friction angle could have been determined using simple tension or pure shear tests. The uniaxial and diametrical compression tests were used here due to their simplicity and equipment availability.
The elliptical cap hardening parameters p a and R were found using a confined uniaxial compression test, signified using a subscript “ c .” This test was performed with the powder located within the die. In contrast to the compact failure tests, the confined uniaxial tests were performed with varying amounts of powder so that the distance between the punches at maximum compression was h = 7.5 mm, regardless of the powder’s relative density. The mass of powder, m , for a target relative density of η is, $$ m=\eta {\rho}_{\mathrm{true}}\frac{\pi {D}^2}{4}h, $$ (20) where “ ρ true ” is the true density of powder. The true density, which is the chemical density of the material, was assumed to equal the powder’s apparent density, which includes the volume of inaccessible pores within particles. The apparent densities of the blends with and without magnesium stearate were measured via helium pycnometry (Micromeritics AccuPyc II 1340, n = 10 measurements each) and found to be 1.553 ± 0.005 and 1.529 ± 0.008 g/cm 3 , respectively. In comparison, the calculated true densities were found to be 1.535 (with MgSt) and 1.542 (without Mgst), respectively. The true density values are closer to each other and in the opposite rank order as compared to the measured values. However, additional investigation also revealed a significant difference in moisture contents of the two blends (2.97–3.21 and 7.21–9.45 % for with and without blends, respectively). The moisture content analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo HG63 halogen moisture analyzer. The test was performed at 110 ˚C for 20 min. The apparent density was used for the calculations in this work since this measurement includes any moisture that may have been absorbed during storage of the materials.
Assuming frictionless die walls, which are approximated in practice by applying magnesium stearate to the die walls prior to testing, measurements were made of the radial σ r , c and axial σ z , c stresses at the instant when the powder densified to the target relative density η . The corresponding hydrostatic and Mises stresses are, $$ {p}_c=-\frac{1}{3}\left({\sigma}_{z,c}+2{\sigma}_{r,c}\right), $$ (21) and, $$ {q}_c=\left|{\sigma}_{z,c}-{\sigma}_{r,c}\right|. $$ (22) Furthermore, assuming that the die is perfectly rigid, i.e., there is no elastic or plastic deformation in the radial direction, $$ {\left.d{\varepsilon}_{ij}^p\right|}_c=d\lambda {\left.\frac{\partial g}{\partial {\sigma}_r}\right|}_c=0. $$ (23) Substituting Eq. ( 4 ) into Eq. ( 23 ) yields, $$ R=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3q}\left({p}_c-{p}_a\right)}. $$ (24) Substituting Eq. ( 24 ) into Eq. ( 5 ) gives a closed form solution for p a , $$ {p}_a=\frac{-3{q}_c-4d \tan \left(\beta \right)}{4{\left( \tan \left(\beta \right)\right)}^2}+\frac{\sqrt{9{q}_c^2+24d{\left( \tan \left(\beta \right)\right)}^2{p}_c{q}_c+16{\left( \tan \left(\beta \right)\right)}^2{q}_c^2}}{4{\left( \tan \left(\beta \right)\right)}^2}. $$ (25) With the stress evolution parameter p a and cap eccentricity R known, the hydrostatic yield stress ( p b in Fig. 3 ) can also be computed as, $$ {p}_b={p}_a\left(1+R \tan \beta \right)+Rd. $$ (26) It is often of interest to report p b as a function of the plastic volumetric strain ε vol p since this relation is used in ABAQUS for calculation of the current stress state. In turn, the plastic volumetric strain may be related to the powder’s relative density according to the relation proposed by Gurson [ ], $$ \eta ={\eta}_0 \exp \left(-{\varepsilon}_{vol}^p\right), $$ (27) where η o is the material’s relative density that corresponds to zero volumetric plastic strain. The relative density at zero volumetric plastic strain is typically taken as the powder’s poured bulk relative density [ ].
The remaining DPC parameters are elastic parameters that can be determined from the material’s elastic recovery during the decompression phase of the confined uniaxial compression test. Assuming a rigid die and isotropic, homogeneous behavior, the generalized Hooke’s law reduces to the following closed form solutions for the Poisson’s ratio, ν , and Young’s modulus, E , $$ \begin{array}{c}v=\frac{\frac{d{\sigma}_{rr}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}}{\frac{d{\sigma}_{rr}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}+\frac{d{\sigma}_{zz}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}}\\ {}E=\frac{d{\sigma}_{zz}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}-2v\frac{d{\sigma}_{rr}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e},\end{array} $$ (28) $$ E=\frac{d{\sigma}_{zz}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}-2v\frac{d{\sigma}_{rr}}{d{\varepsilon}_{zz}^e}. $$ (29)
In Eqs. ( 28 ) and ( 29 ), dσ rr / dε zz e and dσ zz / dε zz e are the slopes of the stress strain curves in the radial and axial directions, respectively, during the material’s elastic recovery. Note that the slopes vary during unloading [ ], so it is critical to ensure that only the linear part of the unloading slope is used in the calculation of the elastic parameters. Only the first 1,000 points of an unloading curve were used to calculate these slopes, corresponding to a punch displacement of 83 μm.
Relative Density Field Calibration
In order to validate the FEM model predictions of the relative density field, x-ray microcomputed tomography (XRCT) imaging was used to map the outline and internal relative density field of an experimentally produced compact with a debossed feature. This section describes the calibration method used for converting x-ray attenuation coefficients to relative densities.
Six-millimeter diameter, 2.5-mm-thick cylindrical slugs of a given formulation were produced for relative densities ranging between 0.60 and 0.95. These slugs were used to produce a calibration curve relating x-ray attenuation coefficients from the XRCT measurements and powder relative densities. The slugs were made by keeping the height constant and varying the powder mass to obtain different relative densities. The slugs were created using the same compaction fixture and speed described in the “ Background ” section. As with the DPC calibration compacts, the die wall and punch surfaces were lubricated with magnesium stearate in order to minimize the influence of friction. The use of flat-faced punches, lubrication, and a small aspect ratio helped to produce slugs with little variation in their internal relative density fields.
The calibration slugs were imaged using a Scano Medical μCT 40 XRCT. X-rays were produced using a voltage of 55 kVp and a power of 8 W. Three thousand six hundred x-ray intensity projections were taken per 180 degree rotation of the cylindrical slug. The resulting spatial resolution of the imaged slugs was 6.43 μm per voxel side. An average of two measurements was used to calculate the absorption intensity for a voxel. An aluminum filter of 1 mm thickness was used to reduce the low energy x-ray intensity, which can be preferentially absorbed and result in beam hardening artifacts [ , , ]. The x-ray absorption coefficients are converted to a gray intensity value ranging between 0 and 255, with larger values corresponding to larger absorption coefficients. A median image filter with a radius of 20 voxels was used to reduce the noise in the images [ , ].
Images from several of the calibration slugs are shown in Fig. 7 , with the corresponding frequency distributions of gray intensity shown in Fig. 8 . Note that the frequency distributions include values from approximately ∼10 8 voxels per slug. A secondary peak is observed in Fig. 8 due to voxels containing a combination of both voids and material. Also observed in the images are larger relative density regions near the circumference of the slugs, which is consistent with previous experimental findings [ , ]. To reduce the influence of wall effects on the determination of a characteristic gray value for a given relative density, a circumferential region of 50 μm at the edge of the compact was excluded from the calculation. Fig. 7 X-ray gray intensity map for a 6.43-μm-thick slice located in the middle of three calibration slugs, each with a different average relative density Fig. 8 Frequency distributions of the x-ray gray scale corresponding to the three slugs shown in Fig. 7 . These frequency distributions include gray intensity values from the entire slug volume
The average bulk density of a slug was determined by dividing the measured mass of powder used to form the slug by the volume of the slug, which was calculated by assuming a cylindrical shape and measuring the slug diameter and height using a micrometer. The slug’s relative density was calculated by dividing its bulk density by the true density of the formulation. The true density was assumed to equal the formulation’s apparent density, which was measured using helium pycnometry as described in the “ Relative Density Field Calibration ” section. The mode of the gray intensity frequency distribution was plotted as a function of the average slug relative density as shown in Fig. 9 . The upper and lower cross bars in the plot correspond to the absorption coefficient values corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles in the cumulative distributions in order to demonstrate the (small) spread in the slug absorption coefficients. The resulting data were fit with a curve of the form, $$ Gray\kern0.28em Intensity=0.3832\ast \exp \left(5.419\ast \eta \right)+144.8, $$ (30) which was then used for converting between gray intensities and relative densities for the given formulation.

The points in the figure correspond to the median value from the absorption coefficient frequency distribution with the upper and lower cross bars corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles
Finite Element Method (FEM) Model Description
The FEM simulations were performed using the commercial FEM package Abaqus/Explicit v6.14 using a VUSDFLD for the implementation of the modified DPC constitutive model. Several assumptions are made in the FEM model, including: (1) negligible air effects, (2) the granular material stress–strain behavior is modeled well by the modified DPC constitutive relations (the “ Background ” section), (3) the punch and die are rigid bodies, and (4) the powder compact, punch, and die system is axisymmetric, allowing for a 2D simulation to represent the full 3D compression process.
The modeled system, shown in Fig. 10 , consisted of a deformable powder contained within a movable upper punch, a fixed lower punch, a fixed die wall on the right hand side, and an axis of symmetry on the left hand side. The powder started with a uniform relative density of 0.3 (equal to the poured bulk density of the powder divided by the true density of the powder) and was flush with the axis of symmetry, die wall, and lower punch, with a flat upper surface just in contact with the upper punch. The powder was modeled using a 2D, four-node, axi-symmetric, linear quad, reduced integration elements (CAX4R). A finer mesh was used close to the upper punch, axi-symmetric, and die wall boundaries in order to better capture the large deformation gradients expected in those regions. Moreover, an adaptive meshing algorithm was employed to allow the elements to conform to large deformations. The mesh is checked and updated every five time steps. The powder was compacted by moving the upper punch downward until the final relative density of the compact was 0.85, which is typical for commercial pharmaceutical tablets [ ]. The upper punch was then retracted until there was no longer contact with the compact surface. The bottom punch remained stationary. Fig. 10 Image showing the initial configuration of the FEM simulations
The powder–die and powder–punch boundaries were modeled as being frictional, with a constant friction coefficient of μ w = 0.0964 for the blend without magnesium stearate and a value of μ w = 0.0786 for the blend with magnesium stearate. This small value is consistent with what might be expected for precision machined tooling surfaces. These friction coefficients were calculated independently of the powder characterization measurements in order to measure the coefficients of friction for unlubricated punches and dies. These measurements were performed to simulate conditions consistent with industrial tableting processes where the tooling has no external lubrication. Using the loads measured at the upper and lower punches, F upper and F lower , respectively, and the radial stress, σ r and applying a force balance to the powder compact and re-arranging to solve for the wall friction coefficient gives, $$ {\mu}_w=\frac{F_{\mathrm{upper}}-{F}_{\mathrm{lower}}}{\pi Dh{\sigma}_r}, $$ (31) where it has been assumed that the friction coefficient and radial stress are uniform over the die wall surface.
The upper punch had a single embossment feature on its surface in order to deboss the compact’s surface. Since the system is axisymmetric, the resulting debossed feature was circular when viewed from above the compact, appearing as the letter “o” on the compact’s surface.
A debossing feature is defined using five parameters [ ] as shown in Fig. 11 : the stroke angle, stroke width, break radius, stroke radius, and degree of pre-pick. The degree of pre-pick is expressed as a percentage of the stroke depth. The stroke depth can be derived from the stroke width and stroke angle. Because a circular feature is studied in the present work, the radius of the feature is an additional independent debossing parameter. The compact radius was set to be six times the stroke width of the feature while the final compact height was approximately five times the stroke width. This radius and height were shown through FEM simulations to be sufficiently large so that they had little influence on the final compact properties near the debossed feature. Fig. 11 An illustration showing the definitions of various debossment parameters
The degree of pre-pick and the stroke angle were studied parametrically in the present work since they are suspected to significantly influence picking behavior [ ]. The remaining parameters were held constant. The values of the various debossing and compact geometric parameters are listed in Table 1 and are representative of values used in the commercial production of pharmaceutical tablets. Table 1 The debossment and compact geometric parameter values used in the FEM studies Parameter Value(s) Stroke angle [deg] 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 Pre-pick [%] 0, 16.7, 25.0, 33.3, 50.0 Stroke width [in.

In order to ensure the FEM results were independent of the computational mesh, a mesh refinement study was performed on the 50 degree stroke angle and 0 % pre-pick case. This case was chosen because the mesh deformation is expected to be the most significant in the parametric studies. The number of elements was increased from 7,500 up to 18,250 with the feature’s stroke depth and stroke angle at the end of decompression used as performance measures (the methods for measuring these quantities are described in the following section). These quantities are used as performance criteria since they are quantities of interest in the present study. The results of the mesh refinement study are summarized in Table 2 . The results show that the change in stroke depth is less than 3 % for the model with the fewest elements compared to the model with most elements, while the change in stroke angle is less than 1 %. Hence, the remainder of the simulations were performed with 12,350 elements in order to provide good accuracy while maintaining reasonable computational cost.

Results
In this section, results from the DPC characterization measurements are presented for the two powder formulations examined in this study. Next, measures used to quantify the FEM-generated debossed feature geometry after the upper punch has been retracted are presented. One of these measures is the relative difference in the debossed volume after retraction compared to the same volume at maximum compression, which is an indication of the overall degree of elastic “spring back” of the compact. Other measures focus more locally on the feature geometry, including the spring back in the stroke depth and stroke angle. Finally, the relative density field in the vicinity of the debossed feature is examined.
Powder DPC Parameter Characterization
The modified DPC parameters for two powder formulations were characterized in the current work. The compositions of these formulations are provided in Table 3 . These particular formulations were chosen since the one without magnesium stearate (MgSt) was expected to result in a larger degree of picking as compared to the one with magnesium stearate. Table 3 The powder formulations characterized and modeled in the present work Component Brand name (manufacturer) %w/w Blend w/o MgSt Blend w/ MgSt Microcrystalline cellulose Avicel PH200 (FMC Corp.) 62.16 61.54 Mannitol Pearlitol SD 200 31.08 30.77 Croscarmellose sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium Type A 6.76 6.69 Magnesium stearate Magnesium Stearate Vegetable 0 1
The modified DPC material parameters for the formulations were measured using the procedures described in the “ Background ” section. The six DPC parameters are plotted in Fig. 12 as functions of the relative density. Because the largest component by weight in the blends is Avicel PH200, DPC parameters measured for pure Avicel PH200 are included in the plots as a point of comparison. Note that modified DPC parameters for Avicel PH102 have been reported previously in the literature [ , ] and have quantitative values similar to the Avicel PH200 values tested here. Fig. 12 DPC material parameters for the formulations used in the present study. Data for Avicel PH200 are included for comparison. The error bars on the data points correspond to error propagation in the measurement of individual components used to calculate each parameter. The “+10 months” data was measured 10 months after the original data and is included to demonstrate the repeatability of the measurements
The difference in the with and without MgSt formulation mechanical properties is typical of blends with small amounts of lubrication as reported in the literature [ , ]. The blend with magnesium stearate has larger cohesion, but both blends have similar elastic stiffness. Usually the addition of a lubricant results in decreased compact strength [ , , ]. Thus, additional measurements were performed on both blends to verify the observed trends. Further discussion on these trends is presented in the conclusions section. Blends with large cohesion have been reported to have larger strength [ ]. An internal friction angle of 70 degrees is consistent with the behavior of pharmaceutical and metal powders [ , ]. The hydrostatic yield strength for the blend without MgSt is slightly larger than the one with MgSt, which means that a larger punch force would be necessary to compact the without-blend to a given relative density as compared to the blend with MgSt [ ]. The addition of a lubricant facilitates particle re-arrangement during compaction and thus a larger relative density is achieved at a smaller punch force.
Debossed Feature Characterization
In this section, the MATLAB™ [ ] image-processing algorithms used for calculating geometric features of the debossed region of the compact at the end of decompression are described. In particular, the final debossed volume, feature stroke angle, and feature stroke depth were measured in order to compare to the corresponding embossed elements on the punch face. Larger differences between debossed and embossed parameters are undesirable since it means that the debossed features are further from the desired specifications. Note that the same image-processing algorithm was used to analyze the FEM results and XRCT images in order to ensure consistency in post-processing.
A 4,096 × 4,096-pixel image of the post-decompression state of a compact was obtained, as is shown in Fig. 13a for an FEM simulation in order to calculate the debossed feature volume as indicated by yellow hatching in Fig. 13f . The image was first converted to a binary, i.e., black and white, representation (Fig. 13b ), then the MATLAB edge-detection function [MATLAB command “edge()”] was used to find the outline of the compact (Fig. 13c ). The edge-detection algorithm inverted the color of the image, which was then re-inverted (Fig. 13d ). A Standard Hough Transform (SHT) [MATLAB command: “hough()”] was applied to detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines in the image. These straight lines were colored based on whether they were horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. All horizontal and vertical lines were colored blue, lines at a small angle to the left of the debossing feature were colored red, and diagonal lines to the right of the feature were colored green (Fig. 13e ). The curved feature was then detected as any part of the remaining upper edge. Next, the top left point on the compact was identified so that the debossed volume could be calculated. This point was found at the intersection of the horizontal line for the top-right edge of the debossed feature and the vertical line from the bottom left edge of the compact. The vertical cross-sectional area of the debossed feature was the area shown by the yellow hatching in Fig. 13f . The debossed volume was this area integrated around the compact’s axis of symmetry. Fig. 13 Steps used in image processing of the FEM and XRCT results
The stroke angle and stroke depth were also determined for the features (Fig. 13g ). For these parameters, a limited angle range Hough transform was used to identify a straight-line portion along the feature walls. The line segments identified by the Hough transform are highlighted in red in Fig. 13g . The stroke angle was then obtained by applying the MATLAB “polyfit” function with a straight-line fit to the contour identified by the Hough transform. To determine the stroke depth of the debossed feature, the MATLAB “findpeaks()” command was used to determine the minimum location of the curved feature. The stroke depth was then calculated by subtracting the vertical location of the minimum for the curved feature from the vertical location of the top right corner of the compact.
In addition to geometric features, the relative density fields were also examined for the parametric studies. Regions of large relative density will have larger cohesion and, thus, are expected to have better mechanical integrity. Conversely, regions of smaller relative density are anticipated to be regions more likely to be subject to damage, such as picking.
Comparison Between FEM and Experiments
To validate the FEM results, compacts with a 0 % pre-pick, 25 degree stroke angle, and 0.2091-mm-stroke depth feature were made using the blend containing magnesium stearate. The tooling in these experiments was not pre-lubricated in order to better represent an industrial system. The powder-tooling friction coefficients used in the FEM simulations are given in the “ Finite Element Method Model Description ” section. The compact’s relative density field was measured using XRCT as outlined in the “ Powder DPC Parameter Characterization ” section and the feature depth and stroke angle were obtained by image processing as outlined in the “ Debossed Feature Characterization ” section. Figure 14 shows the XRCT image in the vicinity of the debossed feature along with the corresponding FEM prediction. The colors in the images correspond to relative density. The current results qualitatively match those recently reported by Laity [ ]. He reported a larger relative density in the valley (“furrow” in the Laity paper) of the debossed feature and a smaller relative density near the shoulders (referred to as “flanks” by Laity). Laity also reported cracking and flaking in the vicinity of the smaller relative density regions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the smaller relative density regions will be prone to picking. Table 4 gives the comparison between the measurements made on the XRCT image and the predictions from the FEM simulation. Three items of significance can be observed from the table. First, the final debossed feature geometric measures in both the experiments and simulations are different than the target values, i.e., the embossing feature values. These differences are due to the elastic spring back of the material. Second, the FEM predictions are close to the measured values in all cases. The largest relative difference of 5.6 % is for the minimum relative density. The remaining parameters are different by less than 3 %. Lastly, the FEM predictions over-predict all aspects of the geometry and relative densities. The reason for this trend is not certain, but may be due to adhesion between the punch surface and compact, which is not accounted for in the FEM simulations.

Influence of Stroke Angle and Pre-Pick
Figures 15 and 16 plot, respectively, the debossed volume and the stroke depth from the FEM simulations, each normalized by the target values measured on the embossing feature, as a function of the degree of pre-pick for different stroke angles and formulations. Normalized values closer to one are more desirable since it means that the feature more faithfully reproduces the target geometry and elastic spring back is smaller. Large degrees of elastic spring back are also correlated with increased propensity for compact failure [ ]. Increasing the degree of pre-pick results in final debossed features that have larger normalized values. Indeed, the normalized values appear to vary linearly with the degree of pre-pick, with the y axis intercept increasing and the slope decreasing with increasing stroke angle. Thus, the influence of stroke angle is smaller as the degree of pre-pick increases. Hence, to decrease elastic spring back and produce truer features, the degree of pre-pick and stroke angle should be increased. These results are consistent with the recommendations of the Tableting Specification Manual [ ], which recommends that in order to reduce the likelihood of picking, the stroke angle and degree of pre-pick should be increased. The addition of MgSt also reduces elastic spring back, but this change in the formulation has a much smaller influence than either stroke angle or degree of pre-pick. Fig. 15 FEM predictions of the normalized debossed volume plotted as a function of the degree of pre-pick. Different symbols correspond to different embossing stroke angles. The open symbols correspond to the formulation with MgSt and closed symbols correspond to the formulation without MgSt Fig. 16 FEM predictions of the normalized stroke depth plotted as a function of the degree of pre-pick.

Figures 15 and 16 show the influence of stroke angle (rows) and pre-pick (columns) on the relative density distribution in the compact for unlubricated (Fig. 17 ) and lubricated (Fig. 18 ) formulations. The images in these figures have been cropped in a consistent manner and use identical relative density scales to facilitate comparison. Larger degrees of pre-pick clearly produce compacts with more uniform relative density, while no obvious trend is observed for varying stroke angle. In general, regions of smaller relative density are observed at the shoulders of the features while a larger relative density region appears at the base of the feature valley. The regions of small relative density are anticipated to be weaker and more prone to damage, such as picking, due to the correspondingly small cohesion in the material. Although not plotted here, the hydrostatic and Mises stress fields look qualitatively similar to the relative density fields.

Waimer et al. [ ] found that for larger stroke angles, slight sticking was observed with material stuck only to the lateral surfaces of the punch while for smaller stroke angles, significant sticking behavior was observed. The current FEM results do not show obvious trends that support or refute these observations. Empirically [ ], it is known that a larger amount of pre-pick leads to smaller relative density gradients in the compact and less sticking in the compact, which is attributed here to a more uniform density gradient in the compact.
The addition of a small amount of lubricant has been reported to produce stronger compacts [ , ]. From Figs. 17 and 18 , it can be seen that the relative density distribution of a compact with magnesium stearate is more uniform when compared to a formulation without lubricant, for the 25 and 50 % pre-pick cases. The effect of lubricant for the 0 % pre-pick case is less obvious. Small amounts of lubricant improve particle rearrangement, thus decreasing density gradients [ ]. This behavior can be observed in the DPC material properties. Adding a small amount of magnesium stearate decreases the hydrostatic yield stress for the compact at large relative densities (Fig. 12 ).
The relative density fields were found to vary little in the region of the debossments as the friction coefficient varied. A region of relative density smaller than the mean appears in a region at the bottom of the compact near the die wall in all of the simulations (not seen in Figs. 17 and 18 ), which is typical of a compact formed via uniaxial compaction with a stationary bottom punch. The size of this low relative density region increases as the friction coefficient increases, consistent with the experimental observations of others, e.g., Sinka et al. [ ] and Briscoe and Rough [ ]. However, this region did not extend to the debossment region and thus had little effect on the results discussed previously.
FEM simulations were also performed to investigate the influence of the powder-tooling friction coefficient. In these simulations, the formulations remained the same, but the powder-tooling friction coefficient had values of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. Recall that the unlubricated tooling in the FEM simulations had friction coefficients of 0.0964 and 0.0786 for the unlubricated and lubricated formulations, respectively.
Density Gradient Below the Debossed Feature Valley
Laity [ ] experimentally measured the compressive stress, presumably at peak load, in the compact as a function of distance below the debossed feature valley. He observed that larger compaction pressures resulted in larger valley compressive stresses and that the compressive stresses reach the background stress value at a distance of approximately 2 mm beneath the valley, regardless of compaction pressure. The distance at which the compressive stress reaches within 1 % of the background value can be considered a measure of the “region of influence” of the debossed feature.
The relative density and hydrostatic stress for a typical FEM case (0 % pre-pick and 50 degree stroke angle) is plotted as a function of distance beneath the debossed feature in Fig. 19 . Two hydrostatic stress distributions are shown in the figure: one corresponding to the hydrostatic stress at maximum compaction load (presumably similar to Laity’s measurements) and the other is post-compaction, i.e., after the punch has lost contact with the powder. The relative density is shown only for the post-compaction state. Similar to Laity, the hydrostatic stress under load appears to decrease exponentially with distance from the valley, $$ p=A+B \exp \left(-Cx\right), $$ (32) where A , B , and C are fitting constants and x is the distance directly beneath the valley of the debossed feature. The post-compaction relative density is also fit well by Eq. ( 32 ). The decay distance in the current work is approximately eight times the depth of the debossed feature as compared to the factor of four observed by Laity. This decay distance is likely to be a function of the formulation properties. It is also interesting to note that the post-compaction hydrostatic stress in the FEM simulated compact has a negative value near the feature, indicating that some of the material is in tension. It is hypothesized that these regions could be susceptible to damage such as picking. Fig. 19 The post-compaction relative density and hydrostatic stress in a 0 % pre-pick, 25 degree stroke angle no-MgSt formulation compact plotted as a function of the distance beneath the base of the debossed feature valley. The hydrostatic stress under maximum load is also plotted in the figure. The solid lines in the figure represent the curve fits
Considering specifically the post-compaction relative density, the quantity A in Eq. ( 32 ) is approximately equal to 0.85, the average relative density of the compact (the same in all cases considered here). The parameter B in Eq. ( 32 ) is solely a function of the maximum relative density immediately beneath the valley. The parameter C controls the decay rate of the exponential curve, and thus provides a measure of the region of influence.
Conclusions
This paper describes a framework for measuring powder DPC properties and using them in an FEM simulation for investigating the debossing of a simple feature on a pharmaceutical compact. The model was validated against several experimental measurements of a debossed feature, including the feature’s stroke angle and stroke depth, as well as the extents of the relative density distribution.
Parametric studies using the FEM model showed that the stroke angle and degree of pre-pick significantly influence the feature dimensions, with larger degrees of pre-pick and stroke angles giving debossed features that more closely match the target (embossment) values. Lubrication plays a much weaker role, at least for the formulations considered here, but did improve the fidelity of the debossed feature slightly. The differences between the debossed and target feature dimensions are due to elastic spring back of the material. The FEM model also shows that the relative density is smallest at the shoulders of the debossed feature and largest at the base of the valley. Although the relative density fields show no obvious trends with stroke angle, the fields are clearly more uniform as the degree of pre-pick increases. The addition of lubricant to the formulation also improves the relative density field uniformity, at least for larger degrees of pre-pick. These results suggest that to improve feature fidelity and decrease the likelihood of damage, larger pre-picks, larger stroke angles, and the addition of a formulation lubricant should be used. It must be noted that in this study the strength of the blend containing magnesium stearate was stronger than the blend without magnesium stearate, which is contrary to what is normally observed [ , , , ]. These blends were stored in an environment in which the humidity was not controlled beyond typical building conditions. A fraction of the same blends, having lower moisture content stored at a different facility showed the opposite trend: the with-MgSt blend was weaker than the without-MgSt blend. Imaging of the different blends showed that the blends with higher moisture content were more agglomerated than the blends with lower moisture content. The apparent densities of the blends with lower moisture content were also different (1.541 ± 0.009 for the without MgSt blend, 1.539 ± 0.007 for the with MgSt blend) and closer to the true density values than the blends with higher moisture content. These results suggest that absorbed moisture has an influence on the blends’ DPC properties. Hence, the influence of the lubricant observed in this work may not be typical.
The current FEM model does not include adhesive interaction between the powder and the punch surface, which is expected to play an important role in picking. In addition, a fracture model is not included in the FEM simulations, which would also be of interest for studying picking. Each of these features will be included in future studies.
