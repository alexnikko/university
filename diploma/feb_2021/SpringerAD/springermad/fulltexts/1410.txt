Introduction
Since 1996, thousands of migratory waterbirds die during spring and fall migrations through the upper Midwest, USA, from infections with Cyathocotyle bushiensis , Sphaeridiotrema spp., and Leyogonimus polyoon (Class: Trematoda) (Cole and Franson ; Sauer et al. ). Annual mortalities caused by these three trematodes have been greater than mortalities caused by bacterial or viral infections for 17 of the last 21 years. To date, the cumulative mortality attributed to these trematodes is estimated to be > 182,000 birds (USGS, NWHC, Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership Event Reporting System ). The primary species comprising the mortalities during 1996–2017 were American Coot ( Fulica americana ) and lesser scaup ( Aythya affinis ) (USGS, NWHC, Wildlife Health Information Sharing Partnership Event Reporting System ). The lesser scaup is a species of conservation concern and is highly susceptible to infections with C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. (Austin et al. ; Herrmann and Sorensen ). Birds become infected by ingesting the non-native Faucet Snail ( Bithynia tentaculata ) that serves as an intermediate host in the Mississippi Flyway (Cole ; Sauer et al. ). The continental breeding population of lesser scaup (hereafter scaup) declined by more than 50% between the 1970s and the 2000s and is currently below the long-term management goal (Strand et al. ; USFWS ). Previous research investigating the intestinal helminth assemblages of fall-migrating scaup concluded that such infections contributed little to the observed reduction in host condition; however, the degree to which C. bushiensis , Sphaeridiotrema spp., and other helminths affect body condition during spring migration and result in cross seasonal effects is unknown (Vest ; Vest et al. ).
Anteau and Afton ( ) proposed the spring condition hypothesis to explain changes in scaup populations. The spring condition hypothesis suggests that reduced recruitment resulting from females reaching the breeding grounds in poor condition is a primary cause for population declines. Reduced condition may result from inadequate forage at stopover locations (Anteau and Afton ), contaminant accumulation (DeVink et al. ), diseases (Friend and Franson ), or a synergism between these factors. Parasitic infections by C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. may rapidly cause mortality, reduce body condition, and result in poor nutrient acquisition or lower survival probability (Cole and Friend ). The invasive Faucet Snail serves as the first and second intermediate host for these introduced trematodes , which are considered responsible for the large-scale mortality events of scaup in the upper Midwest and elsewhere (McLaughlin et al. ; Cole and Friend ; Sauer et al. ; Bergmame et al. ). A possible mechanism underlying the spring condition hypothesis may be a combination of reduced foraging habitat quality, a changing prey base, and increased parasite loads or pathogenicity of infections which reduce body condition of female scaup.
Currently, no studies have examined sub-lethal parasite loads in free-living scaup during spring migration and related health parameters to infections. Our objective was to identify associations between parasite loads and health metrics which might help explain the spring condition hypothesis. Therefore, we collected apparently healthy, free-living female scaup and measured a suite of health metrics for comparison to parasite infection metrics, including intestinal helminth abundance and diversity. Based on prior research, we expected to see negative associations between various helminth infection metrics and select parameters of health indicative of body condition and foraging habitat quality (Hudson and Dobson ; Sepúlveda et al. ; Hanssen et al. ; Shutler et al. ).
Materials and methods
Study area
We selected historically important stopover sites used by scaup during spring migrations along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers and elsewhere in Illinois and Wisconsin, USA, for sampling (Figs. 1 and 2 ; Bellrose ). Most locations used by large numbers of diving ducks in our study region were portions of large, open-water wetlands, reservoirs, and navigation pools along large rivers ranging from 0.25 to 3.0 m in depth. Based on latitude, physiography, and habitat, the study area was divided into regions, including southern Illinois (SI [Rend Lake; 38°06′N, 88°58′W], the Illinois River Valley (IRV [Alton Reach—Peoria Reach; 39°17′N, 90°36′W to 41°01′N, 89°25′W; centered, respectively]), the Central Mississippi River Valley (CMRV [Pools 19 and 12; 40°38′N, 91°10′W and 42°24′N, 90°31′W; centered, respectively]), and the Upper Mississippi River Valley (UMRV [Pools 9–7; 43°21′N, 91°12′W to 43°55′N, 91°21′W; centered, respectively]).

From north to south, regions were Upper Mississippi River Valley (Pools 7–9), Central Mississippi River Valley (Pools 12 and 19), Illinois River Valley (Peoria Reach-Alton Reach), and Southern Illinois (Rend Lake) Fig. 2 A closer view of the collection locations of female lesser scaup ( Aythya affinis ) during spring migrations of 2014 and 2015 through the upper Midwest, USA.

Specimen collection and processing
We collected scaup from 20 sites during spring migration through the Midwest beginning immediately after ice-out and ending after most birds had left. Female scaup ( n = 130) were observed foraging and then lethally collected via layout boat and shotgun during 10 February 2014–20 April 2014 and 11 March 2015–12 April 2015. Carcasses were immediately retrieved, and 2 mL of whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture using a 22G needle on a 5-mL syringe. The blood was then transferred to a microcentrifuge vial treated with ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid, centrifuged at 1500× g for 10 min, and plasma supernatant was collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later biochemical assays. Analytes β-hydroxybutyrate, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and albumin were measured with a Beckman Coulter AU680 Chemistry Analyzer and Beckman Coulter reagents (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Packed cell volume (PCV) was determined in the field using microcapillary tubes centrifuged at 1500× g for 10 min, and the ratio of blood cells to blood volume was measured. Thin blood smears were air dried, fixed for 10 min in 100% methanol, and stained with Wright-Giemsa (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory estimated white blood cell differentials and a heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (an indicator of chronic physiological stress; Krams et al. ) from the prepared slides. Morphometric measurements including body (bill tip to terminal retrix), culmen, wing chord, keel, and tarsometatarsus lengths and body mass were measured prior to necropsy with an eviscerated body mass taken post-necropsy to serve as health indicators and make comparisons to data from previous studies on scaup health (Afton and Ankney ; Vest ). We calculated an index of foraging habitat quality using triglyceride and β-hydroxybutyrate blood metabolites (daily lipid dynamic; DLD) following Anteau and Afton ( ). The lower intestinal tract (pylorus to the cloaca) was removed, sealed at both ends with zip-ties, injected with and stored in 70% ethanol, and refrigerated until parasitological examinations occurred (< 5 months) (England et al. ).
The bill, feet, and feathers were removed from each eviscerated carcass. Each carcass was then ground, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and re-frozen in preparation for proximate analysis. Following Novakofski et al. ( ), a 10-g subsample of the 50-g sample of the homogenized, powdered carcass was oven dried at 110 °C for 24 h to obtain percent moisture. Percent fat was determined by extracting lipids from the oven dried sample using an azeotropic mixture of chloroform/methanol, drying the sample, and weighing. Percent protein was differentiated from the mineral ash percentage by weighing the sample after incineration and deducting the incinerated weight from the remaining mineral ash weight. Processes were duplicated for each scaup, and results were averaged together to generate the final body composition percentages.
To recover helminths, intestines were opened longitudinally, mucosa and ingesta were scraped using a glass microscope slide, repeatedly washed, and concentrated in a conical beaker using a modified sedimentation technique (Bush and Holmes ). The washed sediment was transferred to a 250-mL graduated cylinder, volume increased with tap water to 100 mL, and stirred into suspension. A 10-mL subsample of suspended sediment was removed using an aliquot technique (Bush and Holmes ) and examined under stereoscopic microscope for removal of helminths. All helminths were preserved using 70% ethanol. Nematodes and acanthocephalans were cleared in lactophenol for temporary mounts (Sepúlveda and Kinsella ), whereas trematodes and cestodes were stained using Semichon’s acetocarmine, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Canada balsam. Helminths were then identified to the lowest taxon achievable based on morphological characteristics using compound light microscopy, apart from Sphaeridiotrema specimens (reported herein as Sphaeridiotrema spp.), which require identification methods beyond the scope of our study (McLaughlin et al. ; Bergmame et al. ). Voucher specimens were deposited with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln’s Harold W. Manter Laboratory of Parasitology (accession number: P-2016-028).
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois (protocol nos. 14295 and 11,229), the US Fish and Wildlife Service (MB145466–1), Illinois Department of Natural Resources (NH14.4071, NH15.4071, SS14-02, and SS15-11), and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (SRL-SOD-005-2013).
Statistical analysis
We implemented a multimodel framework using the second-order form of Akaike’s Information Criterion ( AIC c ) to identify possible relationships between health parameters and helminth infection in scaup (Akaike ; Burnham and Anderson ; Anderson ). We selected eight helminth metrics (defined by Bush et al. ) as dependent variables and formulated biologically plausible models using a variety of independent variables related to health and body condition which were hypothesized to serve as predictors of helminth infection ( n = 20). Dependent variables included Brillouin’s species diversity index, total helminth abundance, total cestode abundance, total nematode abundance, total trematode abundance, total acanthocephalan abundance, and intensities of infection with C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. At the parasite species level, only the intensities of infection for C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. were considered from infected scaup since these species are known to be abnormally detrimental to health (Cole and Friend ). Scaup were not collected from southern Illinois during 2014 due to low abundance and extensive ice coverage; thus, we excluded birds collected from this region in 2015 from analyses of body composition.
Negative binomial scaling measures were conducted on dependent variables where necessary to meet the assumptions of normality and equal variance (Zar ). We assessed all independent variables for correlation using Spearman’s rank. To further reduce the number of possible independent variables, we built individual models for each independent variable and compared AIC c scores between these models and the null model (intercept-only). We excluded those variables from further analyses which had a greater AIC c score than the null model due to lack of support resulting in different health parameters being included in each final model set for each dependent variable (Anderson ; Hagy et al. ).
Within the final model set for each dependent variable, we ran all possible combinations of independent variables and second-order interactions that represented biologically plausible relationships (PROC GLMMIX in SAS v 9.4). Final model sets included both univariable and multivariable models. We incorporated the variables year and region of collection as random effects within all candidate models. For candidate models within each model set, we calculated model weight and considered models within four ∆AIC c of the top model to be competitive (Arnold ; Burnham et al. ; Chiavacci et al. ). We assessed relative variable importance within each response variable model set by summing the model weights ( ωi AIC c ) of each independent variable across all candidate models (Burnham and Anderson ; Hagy et al. ). Sums of weights (∑ ωi ) were calculated and compared across all response variables for interpretation of variable importance. When model selection uncertainty arose, we calculated model-averaged beta-coefficient estimates (β), unconditional standard errors (± SE), and 85% confidence limits (CLs; Arnold ; Lyons et al. ) for each dependent variable. Model-averaged beta-coefficients with 85% CLs overlapping zero were considered to have a minimal or no effect.
Results
We estimated 647,174 individual intestinal helminths from 40 taxa were parasitizing 130 female scaup in the upper Midwest, USA, during the spring migrations of 2014 and 2015 (Table 1 ). All scaup were infected with 2 to 23 different helminth taxa. Of the helminths enumerated, 53.9% were comprised of 14 cestode taxa, 44.6% encompassed 20 taxa of trematodes, 1.4% included 4 taxa of nematodes, and less than 0.05% of helminths enumerated belonged to two species of acanthocephala. All helminths recovered were found to be of reproductively mature stages within scaup, except for the digenean Echinostoma trivolvis , several unidentified individuals of a juvenile trematode species (reported herein as Juvenile Trematode), and several unidentified individuals of a juvenile cestode species (reported herein as Juvenile Cestode). Table 1 Prevalence (P; % infected scaup), mean intensity (MI; mean number of helminths from infected scaup), and 95% confidence intervals in parentheses of intestinal helminth species of 130 female lesser scaup ( Aythya affinis ) collected during spring 2014–2015 in four regions of the upper Midwest, USA.

Predictors of total helminth abundance and total cestode abundance had minimal and variable support and were excluded from further investigation (Table 2 ). Additionally, nematodes and acanthocephalans occurred at low abundances and infrequently, respectively, and they were excluded from further analyses apart from being incorporated into the Brillouin’s species diversity index.

Percent body fat, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, albumin, and monocytes were included in final models of Brillouin’s diversity index (Tables 2 and 3 ; Fig. 3 ). Glucose had the greatest weight (∑ ωi = 0.945) and a slight, positive relationship with the diversity index (Table 2 ). Albumin (∑ ωi = 0.832), monocytes (∑ ωi = 0.718), and percent body fat (∑ ωi = 0.528) were negatively associated with Brillouin’s diversity index (Table 2 ).

Non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, albumin, and monocytes were retained in final models of total trematode abundance (Table 4 ). Non-esterified fatty acids accounted for most of variable weight across candidate models (∑ ωi = 0.763). Both non-esterified fatty acids and albumin (∑ ωi = 0.464) were negatively associated with total trematode abundance. The remaining variables accounted for approximately 16% of model weight each, and CLs overlapped zero indicating minimal biological effects (Table 2 and Fig. 4 ).

Basophils were positively associated with C. bushiensis infection intensity (∑ ωi = 0.524; β-estimate ± SE = 0.429 ± 0.217; CLs = 0.117 to 0.741). No other models ranked above the null model for C. bushiensis infection intensity.
Final models of Sphaeridiotrema spp. intensity included percent body fat, PCV, and DLD (Table 5 ). Packed cell volume (∑ ωi = 0.886) and DLD (∑ ωi = 0.536) were negatively associated with Sphaeridiotrema spp. intensity. Percent body fat (∑ ωi = 0.163) had low weight and minimal biological effect on Sphaeridiotrema spp. intensity (Table 2 and Fig. 5 ).

Discussion
We identified relationships between eight health parameters (carcass fat percentage, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, albumin, PCV, basophils, and monocytes) the DLD index and four metrics (Brillouin’s diversity index, total trematode abundance, C. bushiensis infection intensity, and Sphaeridiotrema spp. infection intensity) of helminth infection in free-living scaup. Changes in commonly measured health parameters such as PCV, monocytes, albumin, glucose, and non-esterified fatty acids may indicate intestinal parasite infections and help waterfowl managers understand overall synergism between habitat quality, body condition, and helminth infections. Even moderate infections with gastrointestinal helminths may induce morbidity and lead to decreased body condition when acting in concert with other stressors encountered during spring migration (Shutler et al. ). Decreased body condition from parasitic infections may in turn reduce subsequent fecundity if birds cannot overcome reduced body conditions on the breeding grounds prior to nesting (Tompkins et al. ; Vandegrift et al. ). Given the lowest fat levels and evidence of lower nutrient acquisition (e.g., DLD index) in the northernmost region where the invasive C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp . most commonly occurred (England et al. ), certain helminth taxa and assemblage characteristics may be associated with reduced body condition and nutrient acquisition during spring migration (Tompkins and Begon ; Wobeser ; Vandegrift et al. ). The interaction of parasitic helminths with weakened body condition resulting from decreased forging habitat quality of stopover areas in addition to other stressors may act synergistically to further contribute to a reduced state of overall condition during spring migration. Thus, intestinal parasite loads offer another plausible mechanism underlying the spring condition hypothesis (e.g., helminth-influenced reduction in scaup condition; Anteau and Afton ).
Body fat is important for female scaup due to the energetic demands of spring migration and subsequent reproduction (Anteau and Afton ; Stafford et al. ). The observed negative association between percent body fat and Brillouin’s species diversity index likely reflected the greater helminth species diversity in the upper Mississippi River Valley. England et al. ( ) described shifts in intestinal helminth assemblages of scaup with latitude during spring migration in the Upper Midwest. For example, helminth assemblages shifted from a cestode- to a trematode-dominated assemblage at more northerly latitudes (England ; England et al. ). Although nematodes and acanthocephalans occurred at comparatively low intensities overall during spring in the upper Midwest, their prevalences varied according to species and latitude (England et al. ). The observed shifts in helminth assemblage composition were presumably influenced by geography and a shift in invertebrate intermediate host species and abundances (Hagy et al. ; Roy et al. ), although interspecific competition among helminth taxa may have also contributed to these shifts (Bush and Holmes ). Such competitive interactions between parasites for nutrients within scaup may precipitate other energetically demanding responses (i.e., immune response, increased foraging, etc.), thus further depleting fat reserves and negatively affecting overall condition (Brown et al. ; Shutler et al. ).
The blood plasma metabolites non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, and albumin were associated with intestinal helminth diversity and abundance in this study. Some helminths acquire nutrients directly by ingesting host blood causing perturbations in concentrations of plasma metabolites, or cause inappetence, intestinal malabsorption due to changes in gut permeability, and/or motility which alter homeostasis (Hoste ). Contrary to our initial predition, non-esterified fatty acids were negatively associated with increased total trematode abundance. We had expected a positive relationship between non-esterified fatty acids and total trematode abudance, thus indicating a body fat mobilization response by scaup due to a negative energy balance or other stressors. Fluctuations of non-esterified fatty acid levels in the blood stream may be indicative of starvation and/or malabsorption, and inadequate forage for scaup is suspected in most regions of the Midwest during spring migration (Harris ; Straub et al. ; Hagy et al. ). During fasting or starvation periods, non-esterified fatty acids are released into the blood stream for oxidization into usable energy forms in the muscles and liver after being cleaved from lipid storages. The negative association between non-esterified fatty acids and trematode abundance is reasonable given the increase in trematode species diversity with increased latitude to include the invasive trematodes C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. and the negative energy acquisition of scaup from the northern region of our study area. Lower concentrations of free fatty acids have previously been associated with declining sea duck populations in Finland (Hollmén et al. ), and lowered non-esterified fatty acids influenced by intestinal trematode abundance compounded by the stresses of migration and preparation for breeding could easily induce fasting and/or starvation. Glucose is critical for cell energy balance with plasma levels varying according to stress levels, activity (e.g., migration), and prolonged fasting (Hudelson and Hudelson ). Although a myriad of factors may contribute to increased glucose levels, in birds, it is often a result of high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids released as a stress response (Harris ), and increasing diversity and abundance of helminth infections during spring migration is likely stressful for female scaup. Glucose levels were greater in regions at higher latitudes in our study area and were positively associated with increased helminth species diversity. The northern regions of the study area were more forage species rich than the southern regions (Hagy et al. ), and infections with the introduced trematode species, C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp., became more common as latitude increased, thus possibly contributing to increases in glucose as a stress response. Further analysis of plasma glucose concentrations displayed significantly greater ( x = 177.8 v. 145.7 mg/dL, F 1, 36 = 4.6 P = 0.039) in ducks infected with C. bushiensis and/or Sphaeridiotrema spp. than in ducks found to be uninfected by these trematodes from the same sampling locations indicating a stress-induced response specific to these trematode species. Albumin is a transport protein of calcium and is also tasked with maintaining colloid oncotic pressure in both intra and extravascular spaces (Harr ). Albumin displayed a negative association with Brillouin’s diversity index and total trematode abundance signaling a reduction in plasma albumin, which often coincides with intestinal malabsorption, severe malnutrition, and blood loss, all three of which can be caused by intestinal helminths (Hoste, ; Harr ). Several of these metabolites (free fatty acids, glucose, and albumin) have been previously associated with declining populations of various sea ducks due to the combined effects of habitat degradation and increased pathogenicity (Hollmén et al. ).
The hematological parameters including PCV, monocytes, and basophils were associated with the helminth diversity, C. bushiensis intensity of infection, or Sphaeridiotrema spp. intensity of infection. Lowered PCVs are indicative of anemia and were associated with Sphaeridiotrema spp. infection intensity. Many of the trematodes found parasitizing scaup in this study, especially Sphaeridiotrema spp., feed on blood directly, damage mucosal linings, and cause blood loss through damage to the capillary bed in the intestinal villi that can lead to death by hypovolemic shock (Roscoe and Huffman ; Cole and Friend ). Monocytes are large, phagocytic white blood cells whose cytoplasmic granules contain lysozymes used to destroy invading organisms and chemicals involved in mediating inflammation (Harris ). Monocytes were negatively associated with helminth species diversity, and this association may be due in part to the competition of helminths within the host intestinal tract (Shutler et al. ). Additionally, monocytes may affect the ability of certain helminths to subvert immune system detection by the host (Brown et al. ; Zakeri ) and/or the ability of the host to allocate immune response resources to infection sites during the energetically demanding period of migration (Hanssen et al. ). Basophils are white blood cells that increase in response to inflammation, can suppress parasitic infections (Harris ), and occur in some birds under severe stress (Maxwell ). They are rare in the normal hemogram of most avian species (Maxwell and Roberston ; Harris ) except for some passerines (Vinkler et al. and references therein). Basophils were positively associated with increasing intensity of infection of C. bushiensis , which is appropriate given that this trematode typically infects the ceca, digests intestinal villi and blood, and can cause severe typhlitis leaving a core of necrotic debris in the lumen (Erasmus and Ohman, ; Cole and Friend ).
Energy acquisition as indexed by lipid metabolite levels (e.g., DLD index) was negatively associated with Sphaeridiotrema spp. intensity of infection, suggesting that scaup infected with greater intensities were failing to acquire lipids or were even in a state of negative energy balance. Although the upper Mississippi River Valley had greater food availability than other portions of the study area (Straub et al. ; Hagy et al. ), scaup from this region had the lowest mean DLD value potentially indicating a limitation on nutrient acquisition and fat deposition (Anteau and Afton ). Invertebrates can be intermediate hosts for most of the helminths observed in our study (McDonald , , , ), and invertebrates accounted for most food biomass in the upper Mississippi River Valley (Hagy et al. ). Although no published data were available for our project area, the introduced faucet snail has been implicated in displacement of native gastropods (Harman ) and may have implications for native snails in the Mississippi Flyway which are important food items of scaup (Strayer et al., ). As a result, faucet snails may be more often consumed by scaup in this region than native foods (Herrmann and Sorensen ). Infections with C. bushiensis in ducks may result in severe enteritis, hemorrhage, endogenous reserve depletion, skeletal muscle atrophy, and death (Gagnon et al. ). Cyathocotyle bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. often co-occurred (93% of infected scaup infected with these species), and infected hosts were typically in poor condition based on reduced lipid reserves and PCVs. We suspect DLDs were associated with infections of Sphaeridiotrema spp. because the specific metabolites (e.g., triglycerides and β-hydroxybutyrate [Anteau and Afton ]) used to create the DLD index may be influenced by metabolic interferences (i.e., hemorrhage, malabsorption, cachexia, etc.) associated with Sphaeridiotrema spp. infections. Additionally, the negative relationship between DLDs and Sphaeridiotrema spp. infections may have been an artifact of reduced foraging success caused by behavioral changes due to exacerbated morbidity.
More than 525 trematode species, 260 cestode species, 200 nematode species, and 50 acanthocephalan species are known to infect waterfowl (McDonald , , , ; Schmidt ). Considering the diversity of helminths known to infect waterfowl coupled with the fact that a single scaup may host thousands of helminths from a variety of taxa and show no overt signs of clinical disease (Cole and Friend ; England et al. ), the relationships we identified between native and introduced helminths with decreased health in free-ranging scaup is novel and significant. Prior to the introduction of the non-native trematodes C. bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp. in the upper Mississippi River Valley, Vest ( ) found that body mass and helminth assemblages had remained relatively unchanged in scaup over a 30-year period. Comparing the findings of Vest ( ) with our study emphasizes the potential effects that non-native helminths can have on previously stable parasite-host interactions when combined with other pressures (i.e., contaminants, habitat reduction, competition, etc.). Scaup migrating through the upper Midwest may experience reduced body condition due to reductions in foraging habitat quality (Anteau and Afton ; Anteau and Afton , ), and parasite burdens that were once tolerable may be increasingly detrimental (Vest et al. ).
The mechanisms of parasite-host dynamics are little understood, influenced by many factors, and range in effect from no observable pathology to host death, making population-level effects difficult to assess (Wobeser ). Several previous studies (e.g., Hudson ; Hudson et al. ; Tompkins et al. ; Brown et al. ; Lafferty and Kuris ; Vandegrift et al. ) have challenged the traditional paradigm that parasites only induce mortality on moribund individuals and are not able to significantly influence wild population dynamics (Lack ). Generally, intestinal helminth infections may directly and/or indirectly deprive a host of nutrients vital to continued homeostasis. By identifying several health metrics associated with intestinal parasite loads, we demonstrated additional potential mechanisms underlying the spring condition hypothesis for scaup.
Clearly, the effects of changes in food quantity and quality (Anteau and Afton ), habitat availability and quality (Anteau and Afton ; Drever et al. ), and parasitic infections may be additive and likely impact survival and reproduction for scaup. Although parasites negatively impact hosts by direct and indirect means, it is more likely that a combination of factors contribute to a reduction in condition and subsequent reproductive efforts in scaup. Furthermore, intestinal helminth infections may disproportionately affect individuals in poor or reduced body condition who are unable to ameliorate pathogenic effects due to lack of appropriate nutrition along spring migration corridors (Wobeser ).
We suggest future research to test for direct links between helminth infections, particularly the non-native species, and scaup body condition. Additionally, controlled experiments to identify individual health responses to helminth infection metrics would allow conservation planners to better understand the implications of invasion by faucet snails and presence of harmful trematodes in stopover sites of scaup throughout their range. Ultimately, a better understanding of the interactions between habitat characteristics, parasitic infections, health, and reproduction of scaup would enable habitat managers to make more informed decisions that can benefit continental populations.
