Introduction
With myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), measures of left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), and transient ischemic dilation (TID) have prognostic value. - Therefore, accurate measures of LV volumes are important. Variations in measures are known to exist within a given modality due to software and hardware features. , However, reference values are not readily available. Therefore, it would be important to understand factors that might impact LV volume measurements and if needed, re-establish normal reference values.
Image acquisition parameters, such as camera type, reconstruction filters and software, can all affect LV EDV and ESV measurements by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). - The new cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) gamma cameras have improved sensitivity, energy differentiation, and spatial resolution, which potentially affect volume estimates. , As well, the adoption of resolution recovery software and half-dose protocols may further impact volume measurements. The objective of this study was to understand the potential impact of different SPECT cameras (conventional NaI and CZT) and reconstruction algorithms on measures of LV volumes.
Methods
The University of Ottawa Heart Institute SPECT database (January 2011–June 2014) was screened. Consecutive patients who had normal dipyridamole or exercise stress Tc-99m SPECT MPI were retrospectively identified. Patients were excluded if they were in a non-sinus rhythm, had a history of hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart transplantation, or had conduction disease. This study was approved by the institutional Human Research Ethics Board.
Body surface area (BSA) was calculated using self-reported height and weight, and the Mosteller formula. Patient body height and weight were verified by technologists when necessary.
SPECT Acquisition Protocol
All the patients underwent a 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview; GE Healthcare) rest/stress perfusion protocol in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC). Images were acquired using either a CZT camera with a pixel size of 2.46 mm (Discovery NM 530c, GE Healthcare), or a dual-head NaI gamma camera (Infinia with Hawkeye, pixel size of 6.80 mm (GE Healthcare) and e-CAM, pixel size of 6.60 mm (Siemens Medical Systems)). Patients were triaged to gamma cameras according to body size with larger patients assigned to the NaI gamma cameras and smaller patients to the CZT camera. Also, patients with a higher likelihood of attenuation artifact were preferentially imaged with the Infinia camera. Initially, Infinia patients were imaged using a full-dose Tc-99m protocol, but with the adoption of resolution recovery, patients were subsequently imaged using a half-dose Tc-99m protocol.
All patients were acquired with 8-frame ECG gating using a ±50% R-R interval acceptance window. The NaI gamma cameras used low-energy high-resolution parallel-hole collimators and acquired 60 projections over 180°, with 25 s/projection for rest imaging and 20 s/projection for stress imaging. Reconstructed voxel sizes matched the acquired projection pixel sizes. For the Infinia camera, full-dose studies were reconstructed using ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm (2 iterations, 10 subsets) with post-reconstruction 3D Butterworth filtering (order 10, cut-off 0.35 cycles/cm). The half-dose Infinia studies were processed using Evolution for Cardiac (GE Healthcare) software that performed a MAP-OSEM reconstruction that included collimator modeling and a noise-suppression prior. Similar to full-dose, post-reconstruction filtering was performed (3D Butterworth, order 10, cut-off 0.35 cycles/cm). The e-CAM images were created using third-party software (Hermes Medical Systems) that implemented an OSEM algorithm. Post-reconstruction filtering was with a 3D Butterworth filter (order 5, cut-off 0.55 cycles/cm).
The CZT-based camera, using a set of 19 pinhole collimators (5.1 mm effective diameter), acquired rest and stress images for 5 and 3 minutes with full dose, and 10 and 6 minutes with half dose. Images were reconstructed into 4 mm cubic voxels using vendor-supplied generalized maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation maximization (EM) iterative software that includes collimator modeling and a noise-suppression prior and post-reconstruction was Butterworth filtered (order 7, cut-off 0.37 cycles/cm). The reconstruction parameters were those used clinically and were chosen to visually produce image quality similar to that from the NaI gamma cameras.
‘Non-attenuation-corrected’ images were analyzed using semi-automated software (Corridor4DM SPECT (Invia Medical Imaging Solutions, Ann Arbor Michigan, Version 2012)) to determine the end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and transient ischemic dilation (TID).
Outcome Measures
LV EDV and LV ESV were indexed to BSA (LV EDVi and LV ESVi, respectively) and LV volumes were used to calculate LVEF. Transient ischemic dilation was calculated from ungated stress and rest images.
A total of 150 patients were selected to assess inter- and intra-observer reliability. To ensure representation from the three different SPECT cameras, 25 males and 25 females were randomly selected from each camera. Two observers, blinded to all other measures, independently analyzed the studies sequentially.
Validation Cohort
In order to validate our findings, a prospective cohort (52 normal patients) was obtained. For this population, normal was defined as summed stress score <4, summed difference score = 0 and the absence of myocardial infarction, PCI, CABG, valvular disease or dysrhythmia.
Statistical Analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, Version 20) was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables, presented as means with standard deviations, were compared using the independent samples t test for two groups, and one-way ANOVA for three or more groups. Categorical variables, presented as frequencies with percentages, were compared using Chi-squared analyses. Normal reference values, stratified by camera (CZT, e-CAM, Infinia) and sex, were established as two standard deviations of the mean. The association between patient size measures and LV EDV measures was determined using bivariate Pearson correlations. LV measures were compared between the two NaI cameras (e-CAM and Infinia), and between the CZT and the NaI cameras using the independent samples t-test. Inter- and intra-rater variability was evaluated through the calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05, however, in cases of multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used and P < .0125 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient Demographics
A total of 1953 patients (49.7% men, mean age = 58.9 ± 11.3 years, mean BSA = 1.88 ± 0.22 m 2 ) were analyzed (Table 1 ). The common indications for SPECT MPI were chest pain (62.5%), dyspnea (9.0%), and positive exercise stress test (7.2%). The mean weight and BSA were higher, and age was lower, in patients imaged on the e-CAM and Infinia cameras.

LV Measures, Patient Body Size, and Sex
There was a modest correlation between LV EDV and BSA in men [0.365 (CI 0.309-0.418)] and women [0.354 (CI 0.298-0.408)] and a weak correlation between LV EDV and BMI in men [0.147 (CI 0.085-0.208)] and women [0.143 (CI 0.081-0.204)]. LV EDVi and LV ESVi were smaller in women (Tables 2 , 3 ).

LV Measures and SPECT Camera
There were no significant differences in the indexed volumes between the two NaI gamma cameras, e-CAM, and Infinia with full-dose protocol (Tables 2 , 3 ). Compared to both NaI cameras, the LV volumes obtained with the CZT camera were significantly larger and the LVEF was significantly lower (Tables 2 , 3 ).
Inter- and Intra-observer Variability
There was very good inter- and intra-observer reliability in all patients (Table 4 ).

Full-Dose vs Half-Dose Protocols
A sub-analysis was performed examining the LV volumes associated with a ‘full-dose’ protocol with standard reconstruction software and ‘half-dose’ protocols with resolution recovery software. All LV measures were similar irrespective of protocol (Table 5 ). Compared to Infinia with half-dose protocol, the CZT camera again produced significantly larger LV volumes and significantly lower LVEF.

Validation Cohort
Analysis of the 52-patient validation cohort revealed that CZT measured significantly larger ESVi and EDVi, and significantly smaller LVEF, for both men and women (Table 6 ). These findings are consistent with those of the retrospective group.

Discussion
LV function and volumes measured by SPECT MPI have diagnostic and prognostic value and are incremental to clinical and exercise data. The results of our study suggest that differences in camera affect measures of LV volume and highlight the need for each institution to establish local normal reference values.
Indexed Values for LV Dimensions
The indexed volumes obtained with SPECT correlate well to those obtained with prior measures using echocardiography. The American Society of Echocardiography and European Association of Echocardiography report normal values that are similar to our results (Table 7 ). However, LV volumes measured by SPECT and echocardiography are known to be lower than those of MRI and CT (Table 7 ), which is related to the superior spatial and/or temporal resolution of MRI and CT. , Not only should caution be used when comparing volumes between different imaging modalities, our study highlights that caution is also needed when comparing measures within the same modality.

Effect of Camera on LV Dimensions
As expected, the comparison of LV measures obtained between the e-CAM and Infinia yielded no significant differences after indexing to patient body size across both sexes since both NaI cameras had similar image reconstruction protocols. As such, the samples for these two cameras were combined for subsequent comparison to the CZT gamma camera. Although the patients imaged with the e-CAM and Infinia cameras were larger than those imaged with the CZT, this was mitigated by indexing LV volumes to patient BSA. Even after adjustments, the CZT camera produces consistently larger measurements for LV EDVi and LV ESVi, and smaller LVEF. The volumes measured by CZT are approximately 5 mL/m 2 higher than those obtained by conventional NaI cameras. Therefore, for a person with a BSA of 2.0 m 2 , ESV and EDV would be approximately 10 mL greater on CZT than NaI, representing a 12–27% discrepancy in volume for the same patient. Previous studies have observed that ESVi underestimation can lead to the overestimation of LVEF. To understand the effect of ESV measurements on LVEF using the CZT and NaI cameras, the relationship between ESVi and LVEF was assessed. Both cameras had the same inverse relationship between ESVi and LVEF. These clinically significant differences between LV measurements support the need for camera-specific normative values.
Reconstruction Software
Different algorithms were used to reconstruct data acquired with the Infinia gamma camera: half-dose datasets were reconstructed with MAP-OSEM-RR, whereas full-dose datasets were reconstructed with a simpler OSEM algorithm. Using half-time acquisitions to mimic a half-dose (low-count) study, it was shown that coupling a low-count acquisition with the MAP-OSEM-RR algorithm yielded similar clinical performance to a high-count acquisition processed with the standard OSEM algorithm. The number of counts acquired in a half-time/full-dose study is the same as that acquired in a full-time/half-dose study. The difference between these two protocols is the likelihood of patient motion, which will be greater with the longer full-time/half-dose protocol. Other studies have shown that half-dose images reconstructed with advanced algorithms do give similar results to full-dose images reconstructed with standard algorithms. , Our results confirm this; we found no significant differences in the LV measures between the half-dose and full-dose images acquired on the same Infinia gamma camera. Furthermore, regardless of resolution recovery, Infinia demonstrated the same trend of smaller volumes and larger EF compared to CZT.
The cause of the differences between the CZT and NaI cameras is unclear. One difference between the systems is that the reconstructed voxels of the CZT system are much smaller (4 vs 6.6-6.8 mm). However, other studies have shown that pixel size does not significantly change either EF or volumes for normal-sized hearts, though it can be a factor in small hearts (ESV <20 mL). As the majority of the patients in this study had ESV >20 mL (72.4%), we do not expect this to be the primary factor causing the differences seen between the CZT and NaI systems, but it may have contributed. Determining the exact cause of the differences between the systems requires investigation.
Limitations
The primary limitation of this investigation stems from its retrospective design. Sampling bias exists with the assignment of patients to different cameras: technologists at our institution assigned larger patients to the traditional NaI cameras with larger camera beds and smaller patients to CZT with a smaller camera bed (Table 1 ). Larger patients with higher likelihoods of attenuation artifacts were also preferentially selected for the Infinia camera because of its ability for attenuation correction. As well, when half-dose protocols were implemented at our center, heavier patients were preferentially assigned to Infinia with new reconstruction software and lighter patients to CZT, increasing the weight for the Infinia half-dose population (Table 5 ). To mitigate the effects of this bias, we indexed to body surface area. The resulting measures obtained from this retrospective cohort were validated by the 52 patients imaged on both cameras demonstrating the same range and trend of higher volumes and lower LVEF on CZT compared to NaI.
Our retrospective cohort comprised ‘normal’ patients: although we could not confirm that all patients were truly normal, every effort was made to exclude any factors that could affect LV volumes.
We utilized a single post-processing software package (4DM-SPECT). Another study using Emory toolbox for evaluation also compared a CZT-based camera with a traditional gamma camera and showed that volumes measured by the cameras are different, with a decrease in volume with CZT rather than an increase. Therefore, different software may also produce different results. More importantly, our results may not be translatable to other centres with different hardware and software. Thus, we would advocate that centres establish local normal reference values for LV measurements.
New Knowledge Gained
This study provides indexed values of MPI SPECT-derived LV measures, stratified by sex and gamma camera used for imaging. Statistically significant differences were observed in the indexed LV volumes obtained between different imaging cameras, supporting the need to stratify LV volumes and normal references ranges by camera.
Conclusion
Normal references ranges of LV volumes vary between SPECT cameras, confirming the need for establishing reference values that are camera specific.
