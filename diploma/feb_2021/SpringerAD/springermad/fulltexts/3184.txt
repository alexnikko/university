Introduction
The solubility of a drug is one of the key physico-chemical properties of the bioavailability of the drug. There are plenty of poorly water-soluble drugs under the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), class II in the market. This class of drugs has high permeability but low solubility. Hence, the improvement of the dissolution profile and solubility of BCS class II drugs is still a major challenge and there is growing interest in the pharmaceutical industry to address this significant challenge. Research studies on the improvement of solubility and dissolution of poorly water-soluble drug have been reported by micronisation, use of complexing agents, microemulsion and solid dispersion method [ ]. Sheen et al. reported on the bioavailability of solid dispersion of poorly water-soluble drugs was observed to be higher than the tablet formulation even through the micronised drug and wetting agent were used in the formulation [ ].
Solid dispersion (SD) is one of the most successful strategies to enhance the dissolution profile of poorly water-soluble drugs. It consists of two main components, i.e. a solid carrier and a hydrophobic drug. SD can be prepared by either melting method or solvent methods which include spray drying and lyophilisation [ ]. Generally, the mechanisms of SD in improving the dissolution profile and solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs include particle size reduction, wettability enhancement, contribution of high degree of porosity and transformation of drugs in SD from crystalline to amorphous form. Polymer carrier plays the most important role in polymeric amorphous SD via anti-crystallisation and anti-plasticisation effects, intermolecular interaction between drug and polymer carrier and reduction of molecular mobility of drug in the SD system [ ]. Polymer carriers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and a combination of various types of PEGs have been reported in SD formulations of piroxicam, gliclazide and azithromycin, respectively [ , , ]. Recently, commercial polyesteramide (PEA), Hybrane S1200 and HA 16900 have been used as solubility enhancer in formulating SD of a poorly soluble anti-diabetic drug, glimepiride [ ]. Hybrane S1200 was produced from succinic anhydride and diisopropanol amine.
Polyesteramide is a class of macromolecules, in which the ester linkages are hydrolytically degradable and its amide groups can improve both thermal and mechanical characteristics of the end product. PEA can be synthesised by polycondensation of dicarboxylic acids with diols and diamines, polyesterification or polyamidation of monomer containing amide or ester group and high-temperature interchange reaction of polyesters and polyamides [ ]. This class of synthetic polymer has been proven for various potential applications such as solubility enhancer for drug delivery, surface active agent for detergent, major component for coating and biocompatible material for biomedical devices [ , , , ].
In view of the potential of SD in improving the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs and the potential of PEA as a new class of polymer carrier that can be produced from renewable vegetable oil and oleochemicals in order to minimise environmental issues caused by petrochemical feedstocks, we have synthesised a series of PEA from palm stearin with weight average molecular weight (Mw) ranging from 4000 to 17,000 Da and from stearic acid to develop an amorphous SD for mefenamic acid (MA). Vegetable oil-based PEA with various functional groups, such as hydroxyl terminal groups, carbonyl groups of ester and amide, −NH group of the amide and different chain length of fatty acid chains could possibly enhance the intermolecular forces between the PEA with the drug molecules via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and electrostatic, ionic or hydrophobic forces [ ]. Khougaz et al. reported that the presence of ion-dipole interactions between the PVP carbonyl group and the MK-0591 carboxylate group plays an important role in stabilising amorphous drugs in polymer matrix [ ].
The objectives of this work are to formulate MA SD with the synthesised palm oil-based polyesteramide (POPEA) and stearic acid-based polyesteramide (SAPEA) and to evaluate their role as dissolution enhancer in SD. In vitro dissolution and solubility studies were conducted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) medium and comparisons were made between the formulations with pure MA and a marketed formulation, Fenagesic. Besides, the influence of Mw of the POPEA on the dissolution profiles of the SD was investigated. The crystallinity of the POPEA and SAPEA system in SD and the physical and chemical interactions of the drug-polymer were studied by DSC and FTIR, respectively.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Palm stearin was supplied by MPOB, Malaysia. The stearic, azelaic and adipic acids were purchased from Merck, Germany. Diethanolamine was purchased from ACROS Organics, Belgium. Mefenamic acid (polymorph I) was procured from PI Chemical, Shanghai. The commercial mefenamic acid product, Fenagesic, was purchased from a local pharmacy outlet. All chemicals and solvents used for characterisation and analyses were of analytical grade and were used as received.
Synthesis of Palm Oil-Based and Stearic Acid-Based Polyesteramides
Palm oil-based diethanolamide was synthesised by reacting palm stearin with diethanolamine at the optimal molar ratio of 1:3 at 110 °C for 8 h. The reaction was carried out in a three-necked round-bottom flask and equipped with a thermometer and a condenser. The glycerol by-product in the mixture was eliminated by solvent extraction method using diethyl ether and sodium chloride solution (NaCl 15%). The palm oil-based diethanolamide (hydroxyl value = 209.0 ± 1.2 mg KOH/g sample) was subsequently reacted with azelaic acid at functionality molar ratio (amide/acid) of 1:0.84 (Fig. 1a ). POPEAs with distinct Mw ranged from 4000 to 17,000 Da were produced by manipulating the reaction temperature ranged from 150 to 190 °C and reaction duration ranged 4 to 10 h of each reaction. The reaction was conducted in a three-necked round-bottom flask, equipped with a thermometer and a condenser fitted for distilling water by-product. Nitrogen gas was purged into the reaction mixture to aid in eliminating water and keeping the reaction proceeded. Fig. 1 a Reaction schemes of polyesteramide synthesised from ( i ) palm stearin and ( ii ) stearic acid. b Proposed intermolecular interaction between polyesteramide and mefenamic acid in solid dispersion
Stearic acid-based polyesteramide was synthesised by reacting stearic acid with diethanolamine at molar ratio of 1:1 at 140 °C for 6 h to produce stearic acid-based diethanolamide (hydroxyl value = 233.1 ± 4.8 mg KOH/g sample). The stearic acid-based diethanolamide was subsequently reacted with adipic acid at functionality molar ratio of 1:1 at 170 °C for 4 h (Fig. 1b ). Adipic acid was used in producing SAPEA since azelaic acid produced SAPEA with waxy and tacky properties, causing the SD formulation not able to be pulverised and sieved into fine particles. The reaction was carried out using the same reaction setup as the synthesis of POPEA. The physico-chemical properties of the synthesised POPEA and SAPEA are summarised in Table 1 .

Hydroxyl Value
Hydroxyl value is defined as the milligrams of the potassium hydroxide equivalent to the hydroxyl content of 1 g of sample. The hydroxyl value was determined by using titration method with reference to the AOCS Cd 13–60 method and performed in triplicates.
Acid Value
Acid value is determined as the milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent to the free acid remained in 1 g of sample. The acid value was performed by titration method with the reference to the AOCS Te 2a-64 method. The acid values were performed in triplicates and the average values were recorded.
Gel Permeation Chromatography
Weight average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the PEA were determined by using an integrated gel permeation chromatography system (Agilent PL-GPC 50) equipped with a differential refractive index (DRI)/viscometer detector. The molecular weight distributions of the samples were analysed using a PLgel Mixed D column on the basis of a calibration curve generated from polystyrene standards. The polystyrene standards for PLgel Mixed D column were comprised of ten vials with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 132,900 Da. For calibration, each polystyrene standard with concentration of 2 mg/mL were prepared in tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran stabilised with 250 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene was used as eluent with flow rate of 1.00 mL/min. 0.1 mg of PEA samples were dissolved in 1 mL of tetrahydrofuran before analysis.
Preparation of Solid Dispersion
A series of SD formulations were prepared by hot melt method [ ]. A mixture of POPEA and SAPEA was melted in a glass vial at 65 °C using a temperature-controlled hot plate. The required amount of MA was subsequently added and stirred continuously at 350 rpm for 30 min. Formulations were cooled at room temperature for 6 h. The solidified materials were subsequently milled into powders and sieved with a sieve size of 125 μm.
Preparation of Physical Mixture
Physical mixture was prepared with the ratio of SAPEA/POPEA, 8:2 and 40% w / w of MA. POPEA with Mw of 4000 Da was used in the preparation. Polymer mixture was first prepared by weighing and melting desired amount of SAPEA and POPEA (8:2 w / w ) into a sample vial to obtain a homogenous polymer mixture in molten form. The polymer mixture was then cooled at room temperature for at least 6 h and followed by grinding into fine powder. The physical mixture was then prepared by weighing 60% w / w powder form of polymer mixture and 40% w / w of MA into a sample vial. The polymer and MA mixture was mixed physically by using a vortex mixer for 5 min and kept for subsequent studies. As for the physical mixture prepared for DSC study, considering the small sample size needed, the total amount of physical mixture was reduced to 20 mg and was vortex for 30 s before the DSC study.
Determination of Mefenamic Acid by UV-Vis Spectrophotometry
Mefenamic acid was quantified at 284 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800) [ ]. Stock standard solutions of MA were prepared by sonicating 10 mg of MA in 200 mL of PBS medium (pH 7.4) for 1 h to ensure complete solubility of MA in the medium. Standard solutions were prepared by dilution of the stock solutions with PBS medium (pH 7.4) at concentrations of 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 μg/mL. The UV absorbance of the solutions was determined at a wavelength of maximum absorbance ( λ max ) at 284 nm. The absorbance of the standard solutions was ranged from 0.2 to 2.0. Linearity of the calibration curve was determined to be R 2 = 0.9999 by analysing absorbance of the standard solutions ( n = 3) against the concentration of the prepared standard solutions. To ensure no interference from the synthesised PEA in samples collected from in vitro dissolution test, the synthesised POPEA and SAPEA and its mixture were dissolved in PBS medium at concentration of 50 μg/mL and sonicated for 1 h. The PEA solution was then scanned from 200 to 400 nm −1 regions to determine presence of any λ max peak. Besides, the solution was determined for any UV absorbance at 284 nm.
Drug Content
Drug content was determined by sonicating the accurately weighed amounts of either Fenagesic or the prepared SD formulations in PBS solution (pH 7.4) to ensure complete dissolution of the active ingredient in the solution. The solutions were filtered using 0.22 μm membrane filters before measurement by UV-vis spectrophotometer at 284 nm. All determinations were presented as mean ± SD of three measurements. The criterion for accuracy was set to be within the range of 95% to 105%, whereas precision required a coefficient of variation (CV) within 5%.
Dissolution Study
Drug release profiles of the SD formulations were carried out using a dissolution tester USP Apparatus II (Electrolab, TDT-08 L), paddle method at a rotation rate of 50 rpm at 37 ± 0.5 °C [ ]. The dissolution medium was 900 mL of PBS solution (pH 7.4). The samples (100 mg of MA, SD formulations containing 100 mg of MA, physical mixture containing 100 mg of MA or Fenagesic containing 100 mg of MA) were tested using the dispersed amounts method [ ]. At the appropriate time intervals, 5 mL aliquots were withdrawn from the dissolution medium and filtered using 0.22 μm membrane filters. Fresh dissolution medium (5 mL) was replaced after each withdrawal. The amount of MA in the aliquot was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometer at 284 nm. The MA concentration was determined from the mean of three measurements and expressed as percentage of drug released. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms of the PEA, MA, physical mixture and SD were obtained using Mettler Toledo, DSC823 e instrument. Approximately 5 mg of samples were accurately weighed and put into a sealed aluminium pans with a pin hole in the lid. All samples were analysed at heating range from 25 °C to 260 °C with the flow rate of 10 °C/min under a steam of nitrogen [ ].
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were performed using an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu IR-Tracer-100) for PEA, MA, physical mixture and SD [ ]. The spectra were scanned over a wavenumber ranged between 4000 and 400 cm −1 for 20 scans.
Solubility Test
The equilibrium solubility of MA and SD formulations was determined by adding excess amounts (approximately 150 μg/mL) of sample in PBS solution (pH 7.4). The samples were stirred at 700 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h [ ]. The solutions were filtered through 0.22 μm membrane filters and the absorbance of the filtrate was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometer at 284 nm.
Stability Test
The selected SD formulation were placed into a glass vial, sealed and stored at ambient condition and 40 °C in a universal oven (Memmert, UFB 400) for 30 and 90 days [ ]. The samples after storage were characterised by drug content, dissolution and solubility tests, DSC and FTIR spectroscopy. Besides, the stability of the synthesised POPEA and SAPEA stored at ambient condition for 21 months and 14 months was evaluated by the changes determined in acid value, hydroxyl value, Mw and PDI of the PEA after storage.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicates. The experimental results were expressed as the mean values ± standard deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to analyse the data. The differences were considered to be significant at P < 0.05, using two tailed unpaired t -test for dissolution study and paired t -test for stability test.
Results and Discussion
Selection of Polymer Mixture Ratio and Drug Loading Percentage for Solid Dispersion Formulations
A series of POPEA with distinct Mw ranged from 4000 to 17,000 Da and non-uniform polymer chains with polydispersity index (PDI) ranged from 4.09 to 8.51 were synthesised from palm stearin (Table 1 ). Palm stearin was selected as the starting material over other vegetable oils in consideration of its physical state at room temperature with melting temperature of 50 °C to 55 °C and its less complex fatty acid composition containing three major fatty acids, namely palmitic (C 16:0 ), oleic (C 18:1 ) and stearic (C 18:0 ) acids [ ]. However, the synthesised POPEA was in semi-solid form. It had been reported that different additives were added to the semi-solid dispersion formulation in order to solidify the formulations at room temperature and to improve the physical stability of the formulations under storage conditions [ ]. In this work, instead of using other additional additives, unsaturated long chain stearic acid was used to prepare SAPEA with higher degree of crystallinity and POPEA were incorporated with SAPEA in order to prepare SD which was pulverisable into fine powder form. Stearic acid is one of the major fatty acids in palm stearin, hence the compatibility of POPEA and SAPEA was not an issue when they were used in combination as polymer carrier. Blending of POPEA and SAPEA appeared to be a simple and direct method in this study. The drug contents in all SDs were verified by UV-vis spectrophotometer to ensure the formulations were within the acceptance criterion of 95–105% and CV of the triplicate drug content measurements of each formulation was within the precision acceptance criterion of 5% (Table 2 ). SD containing 10% w / w MA was first formulated using 0, 10 and 20% w / w POPEA blended with SAPEA (SDs 1, 2 and 3) and their release profiles were evaluated (Fig. 2 ). Similarly, the MA content in the dissolution medium was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometer. UV-vis spectrophotometry has been widely used for the quantitative analysis of the active ingredients in dissolution test samples. It is a simple, rapid, inexpensive and reliable method, especially for in vitro dissolution studies involved with many formulations and studied time points [ , , ]. The development of UV-vis spectrophotometric method in in vitro dissolution studies for determination of mefenamic acid in tablet formulation has been reported to be satisfactorily in terms of accuracy, reproducibility and precision [ ]. Hence, UV-vis spectrophotometry was chosen for determination of drug content and dissolution studies of the formulated MA SD. The synthesised POPEA and SAPEA and its mixture were dissolved in PBS medium to ensure no interference with MA before the UV-vis spectrophotometric method was employed. Neither λ max was detected from 200 to 400 cm −1 region nor absorbance value recorded at the set wavelength of 284 nm.

Solid dispersion formulated by SAPEA and combination of SAPEA and POPEA polymer mixture showed higher percentage of drug release when compared to pure MA (Fig. 2 ). At 50 min, SD 1 formulated using merely SAPEA demonstrated 1-fold higher in percentage of drug release, whereas SDs 2 and 3 formulated using 10 and 20% w / w of POPEA showed 2-fold higher in percentage of drug release as compared to pure MA (Fig. 2 ). The effect of combining POPEA with SAPEA as polymer carrier in SD was significant; however, POPEA can only be used up to 20% w / w for the preparation of SD formulations, as limited by its semi-solid physical form at room temperature. Hence, the ratio of polymer carrier (SAPEA/POPEA) 8:2 was chosen for the subsequent studies.
Various percentages (10–40% w / w ) of MA were subsequently dispersed into the optimal polymer mixture to formulate SD 3–SD 6 and the maximum drug loading was up to 40% w / w in SD 6 (Table 2 ). The dissolution profile of SD 6 prepared by loading 40% w / w of MA achieved the highest percentage of drug release, 87% at 360 min (Fig. 2 ). Owusu-Ababio et al. reported on formulation of binary and ternary dispersion system by loading 5 to 50% w / w of MA in PEG 3350 carrier and Tween 20 surfactant [ ]. The ternary system composition of MA/PEG/Tween 4.7:93:2.3 (% w / w ) was reported to have the highest dissolution among the formulations. In this work, SD 6 with high drug loading content (40% w / w MA) achieved the highest dissolution was of advantageous as lesser material was needed for the formulation of SD. The effect of POPEA in SD loading with 40% w / w of MA was further confirmed by comparing SD preparing with 15, 10 and 5% w / w of POPEA in combination with SAPEA (SDs 7, 8 and 9) (Fig. 2 ). It was found that the release rate of SD 6 with 20% w / w of POPEA was the fastest among the tested formulations prepared by lower composition of POPEA in the PEA mixture (SDs 7, 8 and 9). The T 50 of SD 6 was determined at 45 min, whereas the T 50 of SD 7, SD 8 and SD 9 was observed at 60 min.
The Influence of Different Molecular Weight of Polyesteramide as Polymer Carrier for Solid Dispersion Formulations
The influence of Mw of polymer carrier on release rate has been reported in numerous SD studies. Ford et al. reported that the release rate of phenylbutazone/PEG SD was dependent on the Mw of PEG, in which the release rate with low percentage of drug loading (0.5–2%) is inversely proportional to the Mw of PEG (PEG 1500 > PEG4000 > PEG 6000 > PEG 20,000) [ ]. The authors also reported a random rank order of dissolution rate for SD with higher percentage of drug loading; for instance, SD with a loading of 5% of drug showed dissolution rate according to the order of PEG 20,000 > 4000 > 1500 > 6000. The rank order was concluded to be correlated with the crystallinity of the SD given by different chain lengths of polymer, and the release was dependent on the extent to which a molecular dispersion can be formed. In this study, the newly synthesised POPEAs with different Mw, i.e. 4000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000 and 17,000 Da, were blended with SAPEA to formulate MA SD in order to study the influence of Mw of PEA carrier on the release rate of MA. All the formulations were prepared based on the optimised ratio of SAPEA/POPEA (8:2) and drug loading percentage of 40% w / w . SD 6 prepared from POPEA with Mw of 4000 Da showed the fastest 50% release rate ( T 50 ) at 45 min, whereas all other formulations (SD 10–SD 14) prepared from POPEA 6000–17,000 Da showed a slower release rate ( T 50 ) at 60 min (Fig. 3 ). This was consistent with various reports when higher Mw of polymer carrier was used, the drug release rate was slower, as shown in indomethacin, phenylbutazone, griseofulvin and etoposide SD [ , , ]. This is probably due to the polymer chain lengths became more entangled and longer, thus mefenamic acid were hindered in their ability to be released from the carrier [ ]. Besides, drug particles might be trapped in the viscous polymer matrix and lead to delaying in the diffusional release of drug which is related to the higher viscosity of high molecular weight of polymer [ ]. Fig. 3 Dissolution profiles of mefenamic acid (MA), physical mixture (PM) (POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8, mixed physically with 40% w / w of MA), marketed drug (Fenagesic) and solid dispersion (SD) formulations prepared by different molecular weight of POPEA in the PEA mixture (POPEA/SAPEA, 2:8) loaded with 40% w / w of MA (mean ± standard deviation, n = 3). SD 6-SD prepared by POPEA 4000, SD 10-SD prepared by POPEA 6500, SD 11-SD prepared by POPEA 7000, SD 12-SD prepared by POPEA 7500, SD 13-SD prepared by POPEA 8000, SD 14-SD prepared by POPEA 17000
Palm oil-based polyesteramide with Mw of 4000 Da also possessed the highest hydroxyl value of 52 mg KOH/g sample, thus was relatively more hydrophilic as compared to other POPEA with higher Mw (6000 to 17,000 Da) but lower hydroxyl value (14–32 mg KOH/g sample) (Table 1 ). The hydroxyl groups of the PEA could potentially form hydrogen bonding with MA (Fig. 1b ) and disrupt the crystal lattice of the drug. In all cases, the SD formulations, SDs 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 ( T 50 = 45 or 60 min) and physical mixture prepared by POPEA 4000 Da ( T 50 = 150 min) exhibited a faster dissolution rate than the pure MA ( T 50 = 300 mins) (Fig. 3 ). The higher dissolution rate of SD and even physical mixture might be caused by the surface tension lowering effect of the polymer carrier to the medium and resulting in wetting the hydrophobic crystalline surface of the drug [ ]. Similar phenomenon has been reported in the physical mixture of piroxicam and PVP as compared to the pure piroxicam [ ]. Comparison was also made between all the SDs prepared by different Mw of POPEA with a marketed formulation, Fenagesic. Fenagesic showed a slightly higher initial dissolution rate but as time passed, the percentage of drug release was lowered in Fenagesic especially after 150 min as compared to all SDs. At the final time point of 360 min, all the SDs showed 4–9% improvement in percentage of drug release (85.48 ± 1.17–90.66 ± 1.53%) as compared to Fenagesic (81.30 ± 1.26%). Wang et al. reported that the slow release of drug influences the bioavailability and increase the chance for the drug to reach the target site in active form [ ]; therefore, further investigation on the pharmacokinetics of the formulation will be of advantageous. Nevertheless, the dissolution profiles of all the tested SD formulations had shown no significant differences ( P > 0.05) as compared to the marketed Fenagesic.
Thermal Analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to determine the physical state and degree of crystallinity of PEA carriers and the MA SD. The use of DSC has been proposed as a rapid method for evaluation the physico-chemical interaction between drug and excipient; however, FTIR spectroscopy is also necessary, as complementary tool aiding in the interpretation of DSC [ ]. The DSC curves of POPEA with Mw of 4000 Da and SAPEA displayed two similar endothermic peaks at the range of 44 to 52 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Leuner et al. reviewed that melting point of PEG carriers under 65 °C were advantageous for the manufacture of SD by the hot melt method [ ]. The combination of PEA mix (SAPEA/POPEA, 8:2) by blending SAPEA with POPEA with different Mw also demonstrated the two similar endothermic peaks at 43–45 and 51–54 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In order to confirm the level of crystallinity of the PEAs, the melting enthalpy values were evaluated (Table 3 ). The enthalpy value of SAPEA synthesised from stearic acid was much higher (51.53 J/g) as compared to POPEA 4000 (14.38 J/g), implying that SAPEA was in a more ordered arrangement form than that of POPEA 4000. Besides, the melting enthalpy values of PEA mixture with different Mw of POPEA (SAPEA/POPEA, 8:2) were decreased significantly (31.70–36.14 J/g) as compared to the single material of SAPEA (51.53 J/g). This showed that the PEA mixtures were all in less ordered arrangement than the SAPEA, thus requiring much less energy to overcome the lattice forces [ ]. On the other hand, the enthalpy of PEA mixture was higher as compared to the single POPEA material. The combination of POPEA with SAPEA had provided sufficient crystallinity as solid polymer carrier for the SD formulation.

The DSC thermograms of pure MA, MA physical mixture and its SD are shown in Figure 4 . It has been reported that MA has two known polymorphic forms, the stable polymorph I (form I) and the metastable polymorph II (form II). Polymorph I has melting point at 170 °C whereas polymorph II has melting point at 231 °C. As shown in the DSC thermogram (Fig. 4 ), the pure MA demonstrated a sharp endothermic peak at 229.48 °C and a small endothermic peak at 167.72 °C, indicating the transformation of polymorph I to polymorph II during the heating process of DSC [ ]. The DSC thermogram of the physical mixture prepared with POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8 ( w / w ) and SDs demonstrated the endothermic peaks of the PEA carrier at 44.22 and 51.52 °C and the MA endothermic peak was broadened and shifted from 229.48 °C to a lower temperature at 210.94 and 183 °C. The broad endothermic peak of MA with lower meting temperature indicated that some amount of drug was partly dissolved in the PEA carrier during the physical mixing process [ ]. For SD, the endothermic peak of MA was only detected in SD loaded with 40% w / w of MA. This is consistent with a previous report in which endothermic peak for MA in polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene SD was not significant in formulations loaded with <30% of MA [ ]. The endothermic peak of MA becoming more prominent in the DSC curves for the polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene SD with 35–50% loading of MA. This could be attributed to the solubilisation of certain portions of MA in the amorphous polymer carrier, but when increased amount of MA loaded in the SD, the crystalline MA that was unable to dissolve will disperse within the polymer carrier and exhibited the endothermic peak of MA. Besides, it was observed that the melting temperature of MA in SD 6 (40% w / w MA) was further shifted to 194.34 and 178.69 °C as compared to pure MA (229.48 °C) and physical mixture (210.94 and 183 °C). The reduction in the melting point of the MA may be attributed to the intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding between MA and PEA polymer carrier (Fig. 1b ), that subsequently decrease the extent of intermolecular forces between the MA molecules, thus lowering the melting point and enthalpy energy of the MA crystal lattice [ , ]. Taking these two observations, we deduce that certain portion of MA was solubilised in the PEA carrier and transformed into amorphous form. Thus, only SD with high percentage of MA formulation (40% w / w ) demonstrated broad and shifted endothermic peak of MA.

All SDs were prepared by POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8 ( w / w ). SD 3-loaded with 10% w / w of MA, SD 4-loaded with 20% w / w of MA, SD 5-loaded with 30% w / w of MA, SD 6-loaded with 40% w / w of MA. Physical mixture-POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8 mixed physically with 40% w / w of MA
The effect of the POPEA on the crystallinity of SD was further evaluated. SDs 6 and 7 prepared by 20% w / w and 15% w / w of POPEA recorded lower melting peaks of 43 and 49 °C while SDs 8 and 9 formulated by 10% w / w and 5% w / w of POPEA showed their melting peaks at 44 and 50 °C. The higher degree of crystallinity in SD 8 and SD 9 formulated by higher composition of SAPEA had of course resulted in higher enthalpy energies of 34.56 and 39.67 J/g whereas SD 6 and SD 7 demonstrated enthalpy energies of 24.31 and 24.90 J/g, respectively (Table 3 ). Besides, the influence of Mw of PEA in thermal characteristics of the formulated MA SD, the DSC thermograms of the SD (SDs 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14) were studied (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The endothermic peaks of MA in all SDs were detected by showing two broadened peaks at 178–196 °C. All SD possessed lower enthalpy energy (24–30 J/g) as compared to pure MA (172.90 J/g) and PEA mix (32–36 J/g) (Table 3 ). This shows that the SD formulations were in less ordered amorphous arrangement compared to crystalline MA and even the PEA mix carrier [ ]. Amorphous form of drug has been reported to have higher dissolution rate than in its crystalline counterpart [ ]. The enthalpy values of SD prepared from POPEA 4000 (SD 6) recorded the lowest energy of 24.31 J/g as compared to SD prepared from higher Mw of POPEA (SD 10 to SD 14) with enthalpy ranged from 25.90 to 30.14 J/g (Table 3 ). Vegetable oil-based emulsifiers such as monoacylglycerol produced from edible oil and hydrogenated oil are commonly used as emulsifier, as well as anti-crystallisation agent in semi-solid fats [ ]. The addition of these additives modifies the stages of nucleation and growth of the crystalline network. Interestingly, in this work, the PEA polymer carrier synthesised from palm stearin also plays the role as crystallisation inhibitor in the SD system. The first step of drug crystallisation is nucleation at lower temperature, followed by crystal growth which requires higher temperature [ ]. Polymeric excipients with crystallisation inhibition effect retard the nucleation rate of drug by decreasing the free drug concentration available for nuclei seed formation [ ].
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine any molecular change in drug due to chemical interaction between the drugs with polymer carrier during the formulation processes. It is also able to demonstrate any chemical alteration occur to drug during storage. The FTIR spectra of MA, PEA mixture (SAPEA/POPEA 4000, 8:2), MA physical mixture (POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8 with 40% w / w of MA) and SD formulations are shown in Fig. 5 . The MA pure drug has shown characteristic peaks at 3307 and 1572 cm −1 indicating N–H stretching and N–H bending of the secondary amine, 1645 cm −1 indicating C=O stretching of the carboxylic acid, 1504 cm −1 indicating C=C stretching, 748 cm −1 indicating aromatic stretching and 2974–2943 cm −1 indicating the C–H stretching [ ]. The PEA mixture (SAPEA/POPEA 4000, 8:2) has shown its characteristic peaks at 1730 cm −1 indicating C=O stretching for ester group, 1643 cm −1 indicating C=O stretching for amide group, 3450 cm −1 broad band indicating O–H group, 2916 and 2849 cm −1 indicating C–H stretching and 721 cm −1 indicating C–H rocking [ ]. All the characteristic peaks for MA and PEA were observed in the FTIR spectra of physical mixture and SD formulation, except that the C=O stretching peak of amide group (PEA carrier) was observed to be overlapping with the C=O stretching peak of carboxylic acid (MA) with a slightly broadened peak at 1649 cm −1 . Similar characteristic peaks captured in the FTIR spectra of SD and physical mixture demonstrating no chemical changes occur in MA during the mixing process of physical mixture and SD preparation. FTIR had also been used to study the spectral changes caused by the hydrogen bonding between polymer carrier and drug [ ]. Comparison was made between the FTIR spectra of the SD and physical mixture samples and a red shift, i.e. a decrease in infrared frequency of the O–H band from 3547 cm −1 (physical mixture) to 3505 cm −1 was observed in SD. Red shift of O–H band in the SD sample is an indication of strengthening of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the OH group and the electron donor [ ]. Besides, there was also a small red shift effect observed on –NH stretching from 3312 cm −1 (physical mixture) to 3310 cm −1 in SD 6 sample. The larger frequency red shift of O–H band and the small red shift of –NH stretching indicating the OH groups of the PEA act as the proton donor and –NH groups of the MA act as an acceptor [ ]. The force field of the OH bond is reduced by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding formation, thus reflecting in larger frequency red shift than the –NH bond. The SD technique had induced intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the OH group of the PEA and NH group of PEA (Fig. 1b ), as compared to the physically mixed samples between MA and PEA. Fig. 5 FTIR spectra of mefenamic acid (MA), PEA mixture (POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8), physical mixture and solid dispersion formulation (SD 6) prepared by POPEA 4000/SAPEA, 2:8, loaded with 40% w /w of MA
Solubility Test
All SD formulations showed high solubility ranging from 100 to 141 μg/mL as compared to pure MA powder (96.54 ± 8.92 μg/mL) (Table 4 ). When evaluating the influence of PEA in the SD system, the solubility of SD followed the rank order of percentage of PEA used in the formulation, i.e. SD 6 prepared by 20% w / w POPEA 4000 gave the highest solubility of 137.22 ± 1.94 μg/mL and SD 9 prepared by 5% w / w POPEA 4000 gave the lowest solubility of 122.96 ± 1.85 μg/mL. The probable reason for the improvement of solubility in these formulations is the locally imposed solubilising action of PEA as dissolution enhancer [ ], and this is supported by the shifted melting peak of MA (178–196 °C) and lowering of enthalpy for SD 6 (24.31 J/g) than SDs 7–9 (24.90–39.67 J/g) in the DSC analysis (Table 3 ). Besides that, particle size reduction, higher wettability of drug in the presence of dissolution enhancer and formation of amorphous particle could also be considered as the mechanisms for enhancing the solubility of a poorly soluble drug from solid dispersion system [ ].

Stability Study
Solid dispersion prepared from POPEA 4000 and SAPEA, 2:8 ( w / w ) loaded with 40% w / w of MA (SD 6) was selected for stability study for 30 and 90 days as it obtained the fastest release rate ( T 50 = 45 min) with good solubility in PBS solution (137 μg/mL). Drug contents of SD 6 before and after storage for 30 and 90 days at ambient condition (∼25 °C) and 40 °C were compared and there were no significant difference ( P > 0.05) between these formulations (Table 5 ). As for the solubility tests, the formulations also demonstrated no significant difference ( P > 0.05) with the range of 132 to 140 μg/mL after storage for 30 and 90 days at ambient condition and 40 °C as compared to freshly prepared formulation with solubility of 137 μg/mL.

In terms of dissolution profiles, T 50 for SD 6 formulation stored at ambient condition were maintained at 45 min after 30 and 90 days of storage (Table 5 ). However, T 50 for SD 6 after storing at 40 °C for 30 and 90 days were delayed to 60 min. The dissolution profiles for samples stored at ambient condition for 30 and 90 days (SD 6A and SD 6C) exhibited no significant differences ( P > 0.05) with the freshly prepared formulation, SD 6, while samples stored at elevated temperature (SD 6B and SD 6D) demonstrated differences ( P < 0.05) with SD 6.
Solid dispersion underwent stability test were also characterised by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy. The DSC thermograms of SD (SDs 6, 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D) after storage for 30 and 90 days at ambient condition and 40 °C were evaluated (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The amorphous form of drug is thermodynamically unstable and may recrystallise after some time, thus compromising the bioavailability of the active ingredient [ ]. All the DSC curves of the SD before and after storage test were similar without showing any significant sharp peak for MA. This shows that the SD formulations did not undergo recrystallisation of MA and was stable at ambient condition and elevated temperature (40 °C) for 3 months. The FTIR spectra of all the SD formulations stored at ambient condition and 40 °C for 90 days did not exhibit any difference in the functional group characteristic peaks as compared to the freshly prepared SD (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This demonstrated that there was no chemical interaction between the MA and PEA carrier during the storage test for 3 months at ambient temperature and 40 °C.
The stability of the synthesised POPEA and SAPEA after storage at ambient condition for 21 and 14 months, respectively, was also evaluated (Table 6 ). POPEA was found to be stable after storage for 21 months with insignificant changes in acid value, hydroxyl value and Mw. However, SAPEA was experiencing degradation by showing significant breakdown in Mw from 33,156 to 14,461 Da. This could probably cause by the higher acid value (50.74 mg KOH/g sample) in SAPEA that was synthesised from stearic acid. Free acid remained in the SAPEA potentially catalysed degradation of the ester and amide linkages of the PEA; hence, SAPEA was relatively less stable than that of POPEA (acid value = 0.64 mg KOH/g sample).

Conclusions
Mefenamic acid SD was successfully formulated by combination of PEA with distinct Mw and PDI, i.e. POPEA synthesised from palm stearin and SAPEA synthesised from stearic acid. The miscibility of the two PEAs was confirmed by DSC. Pre-formulation was conducted to select the optimal ratio for the polymer mixture and the influence of percentage of polymer carrier and Mw of the polymer carrier were studied. The SD was able to load in 40% w / w of MA, and all the SDs prepared exhibited 5–7-fold improvement in 50% drug release ( T 50 ) as compared to the pure MA. Besides, the dissolution profile and solubility of MA were enhanced as compared to the marketed product, Fenagesic, although the difference was not significant ( P > 0.05). The enhancement of solubility and dissolution of the current formulation was resulted by the effect of particle size reduction, surface tension lowering effect of the polymer carrier resulting in increasing wettability of the drug and transformation of drug to amorphous form. The DSC endothermic peak of MA in SD demonstrates peak shifting and broadening from 230 to 193–196 °C, evident in the transformation of crystalline MA into amorphous form in SD. The FTIR spectra showed no chemical change in MA after formulating into MA SD using the synthesised PEA as carrier. The red shift of OH band from 3547 cm −1 in physical mixture to 3505 cm −1 in SD marked the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the PEA and MA by employing the SD technique. The optimum formulation, SD 6 was stable under storage for 90 days at ambient condition ( P > 0.05) in the aspects of drug content, solubility and dissolution profiles. When tested at elevated temperature (40 °C), the formulation was stable for drug content and solubility test ( P > 0.05), but experiencing regression in dissolution profile ( P < 0.05) with a 15-min delay in T 50 . For the synthesised PEA, POPEA was found to be stable after storage at ambient condition for 21 months, but SAPEA was unstable due to the high acid value had caused degradation in SAPEA after storage for 14 months. Further investigation on improving stability of the synthesised SAPEA, stability of PEA prepared SD at elevated storage temperature and safety profile assessment of the synthesised PEA will next be conducted.
