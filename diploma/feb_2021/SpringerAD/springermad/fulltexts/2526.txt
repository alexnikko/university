Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common form of dementia in aging population worldwide. It is associated with loss of cholinergic neurons, accumulation of amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Association ; Ittner and Götz ; Singh et al. ). The behavioral manifestations include difficulties remembering latest events, diminished communication, poor judgment and eventually trouble in conducting even the most basic tasks like swallowing or walking (Association ). The World Alzheimer report 2015 states that the disease burden of dementia (including AD) is currently 46.8 million and forecasts that the incidence will double every 20 years, with an estimated increase of up to 74.7 million in 2030 and up to 131.5 million people in 2050 (Prince ) .
Initially, neuroinflammation was assumed to occur only as an epiphenomenon in the pathogenesis of AD (Heppner et al. ). However, burgeoning evidence implies that neuroinflammation is not a mere bystander but a dynamic contributor to the progression of AD (Heppner et al. ; Heneka et al. ). AD has been attributed to inept Aβ clearance by microglia (Hickman et al. ; Krabbe et al. ) and increased cytokine concentrations (Patel et al. ). Substantial literature cites that systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin from the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria, causes learning and memory deficits (Hou et al. ; Gong et al. ) and gives rise to events that accelerate AD pathology (Badshah et al. ; Choi et al. ; Ma et al. ). LPS administration leads to neuroinflammation, triggers microglial activation and leading to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (Hou et al. ; Gong et al. ; Deng et al. ). These cytokines induce amyloidogenesis via upregulation of β -secretase (BACE 1) activity and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Deng et al. ). Moreover, LPS administration has been reported to induce tau hyperphosphorylation (Kitazawa et al. ).
Trigonelline (TRG) is a naturally occurring alkaloid isolated from coffee beans, fenugreek etc. (Ilavenil et al. ). TRG has been reported to possess neuroprotective effects in Parkinson’s disease (Gaur et al. ) and diabetes induced auditory neuropathy (Hong et al. ). Also, it has been reported that TRG elicited axonal neurite outgrowth (Tohda et al. ) and reversed the memory impairment caused by Aβ 25–35 (Tohda et al. ). Moreover other beneficial effects of TRG such as antidiabetic, anticancer and hepatoprotective activity have been reported (Kamble and Bodhankar ; Aldakinah et al. ; Arlt et al. ; Mayakrishnan et al. ;). Considering the diverse pharmacological effects of TRG and the beneficial effects of TRG as a neuroprotective agent, we postulated that TRG may show beneficial effects in neuroinflammation mediated cognitive deficit. As no study has been conducted to investigate the effect of TRG on neuroinflammation till date, we designed this study to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of TRG against LPS mediated cognitive impairment and to study the mechanisms involved thereof.
Materials and methods
Drugs and treatment schedule
Trigonelline hydrochloride and LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B5 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co Ltd. Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) was provided as a gift sample from Dr. Reddy’s laboratory Ltd., Hyderabad, India. Mouse ELISA kits of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TNF- α and IL-6 were purchased from Krishgen BioSystems. All the other chemicals were of analytical grade. TRG, DNP and LPS were dissolved in saline for oral (po) and intraperitoneal ( ip ) administration respectively. Thirty animals were used for the study which was randomized into five groups, consisting of 6 animals in each group. The animals were administered the drugs for a period of 14 days after which 250 μg/kg of LPS was concurrently administered via the ip route for the next 7 days. The drug administration was continued till the animals were sacrificed on day 28. The dose of TRG was determined by earlier studies conducted at our laboratory (Chowdhury et al. ). The animals were dosed as follows: Group I: Vehicle control group (0.3 ml) saline Group II: Saline (0.3 ml) + LPS (250 μg/kg ip ) Group III: TRG (50 mg/kg po ) + LPS (250 μg/kg ip ) Group IV: TRG (100 mg/kg po ) + LPS (250 μg/kg ip ) Group V: DNP (1 mg/kg ip ) + LPS (250 μg/kg ip )
The outline of the treatment schedule and behavioral test is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Diagram depicting Treatment schedule. Saline, TRG and DNP pretreatment were carried out for 14 days. From day 15 to day 21 onwards, LPS (250 μg/kg ip ) was injected. From Day 22 to day 27 behavioral evaluations were carried out in MWM and Y-maze. Post behavioural evaluation, the mice were sacrificed and the biochemical and cytokine estimations were carried out
Animals
Procurement of adult male Swiss albino mice weighing 25–30 g was done from Bombay Veterinary College, Mumbai, India. Animals were acclimatized for 1 week to the laboratory conditions at room temperature before conducting any experimental procedures. The animal studies were approved by the institutional animal Ethics Committee (IAEC project no. 2016/5B). The experimental procedures were conducted in conformity with institutional animal ethics committee and Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) guidelines, India for the care and use of laboratory animals. The animals were housed in opaque plastic polypropylene cages under standard conditions of 12 h light/dark circle with food and water ad libitum. Behavioral testing was conducted between 9.00 and 17.00 h to reduce the influence of circadian rhythm.
Behavioral assessments
Assessment of cognitive performance
Morris water maze (MWM) task
The MWM task was selected to evaluate spatial learning and memory and carried out from day 22 to day 26 after initiating the treatment. The task was carried out as explained previously (Jang et al. ) with slight modifications. A large circular tank (90 cm in diameter, 45 cm in height), with internal surface rendered opaque by milk, was used to perform the experiment. The tank was filled up to 30 cm with water retained at 28 ± 1 ° C. Four different quadrants of equal area were demarcated with the help of a thread and a circular escape platform (4.5 cm) was placed in the center of one of the quadrants, 1 cm below the water surface. Different visual cues were positioned to assist the mice in recalling the position of the platform. The platform position remained unchanged during the entire assessment. Mice underwent training in the MWM four times consecutively with an inter-trial gap of 5 min.
For each training trial, the mice were gently placed in different quadrants in the water pool, facing the wall of pool and allowed 90 s to locate the platform. The mice were then allowed to stay on the platform for next 30 s. If the mice failed to reach the platform within 90 s, they were gently guided to reach the platform and allowed to stay there for next 30 s. The trial was carried out for four consecutive days. Subsequent to the last training session, a probe trial was conducted on the fifth day, where the hidden platform was removed and the mice were allowed 90 s to look for it in the target quadrant. The time spent by the mice in the target quadrant was recorded.
Y maze
The Y maze is a simple three armed maze for evaluation of working memory which measures the inherent ability of the mice to investigate novel environments. The Y maze was designed from white painted wood, with 3 arms, each placed at 120° to each other. Each arm of the maze measured 8 cm X 30 cm X 15 cm (width X length X height) (Ma et al. ) and the arms were designated as A, B and C. The mice were gently placed at the centre of the apparatus and allowed to freely roam around in the maze for 8 min. Spontaneous alteration behaviour (SAB) was studied by the number of alternations (i.e., consecutive entry sequences of ABC, CAB, or BCA, but not BAB) and the number of arm entries. The number of arm entries was also used as an index for locomotor activity. The maze was wiped thoroughly between the trials to reduce any olfactory interference. Mice were treated with TRG 1 h (50, 100 mg/kg po ) and in case of DNP (1 mg/kg ip ) 30 min prior to the conduct of the test. The percentage alternation was evaluated calculated according to the following equation: percentage alternation = [(number of alternations)/ (total arm entries - 2)] × 100 (Joshi et al. ).
Biochemical assessments
After the conduct of behavioural tests, the mice were decapitated, brains dissected and the cortex and hippocampus were rapidly isolated and placed immediately in ice cold isotonic saline. Homogenization of the hippocampus and cortex tissue was carried out separately using 0.1 M Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). The homogenate (10% w / v ) was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant was employed for carrying out the biochemical estimations.
Estimation of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE)
The AChE estimation was done by the method described earlier (Ellman et al. ). Briefly, 0.1 M pH 8.0 phosphate buffer was incubated for 5 min with equal volumes of homogenate and 0.01 M 5, 5′-dithiobis (2-nitro benzoic acid) (DTNB). Later, acetyl thiocholine iodide was added as a substrate and change in absorbance was recorded at 412 nm using a spectrophotometer (Epoch, Biotek, USA).
Estimation of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
The SOD activity was measured by the method described earlier (Nandi and Chatterjee ). Briefly, assay mixture consisted of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), pyrogollal (2.6 mmol/l in 10 mmol/l HCl) and tissue homogenate. The SOD activity was evaluated by the change in absorbance measured spectrophotometrically ((Epoch, Biotek, USA) at 325 nm for 5 min with 30 s interval. One unit of enzyme represents the enzyme activity that inhibits auto- oxidation of pyrogallol by 50%.
Estimation of reduced glutathione (GSH)
The GSH levels were measured using the methods described earlier (Smith et al. ) using DTNB reagent. Tissue homogenate was incubated with DTNB and was read spectrophotometrically (Epoch, Biotek, USA) at absorbance of 412 nm. The amount of GSH in the sample was calculated in μg/mg of protein with the help of a standard curve.
Estimation of Malonaldehde (MDA)
The MDA estimation was done using the method described previously (Ohkawa et al. ). 10% tissue homogenate was added to 20% acetic acid, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 0.8% thiobarbaturic acid (TBA) and the volume made up to 4 ml using distilled water. A butanol: pyridine mixture was added to the above reaction mixture, and centrifuged at room temperature. An aliquot of clear supernatant was withdrawn from the above mixture and spectrophotometrically analyzed at 532 nm (Epoch, Biotek, USA) against blank. The MDA content was calculated and expressed as nmol MDA formed per microgram protein.
Estimation of protein
The protein content was estimated using BSA as a standard using the method described previously (Gornall et al. ). (Results not shown).
Estimation of TNF-α, IL-6 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
The quantifications of TNF- α, IL-6 and BDNF were done by using mouse immunoassay kits provided by Krishgen Bio Systems, CA, USA. All the assays were performed in duplicate and absorbance was read on an ELISA plate reader (BIO-RAD). The concentration of each sample was calculated from plotted standard curves.
Statistical analysis
Data from behavioral and biochemical determinations were expressed as mean ± SEM (standard errors of the mean). The escape latency in the MWM task was analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Bonferroni’s test. For the probe trial in MWM task, % SAB, biochemical estimations, BDNF and cytokine estimations, statistical analysis of data was carried out by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey’s Test. Differences were considered statistically significant if the P < 0.05. GraphPad Prism Software 5.0 Version (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Effect of TRG on LPS-induced memory impairment
MWM task
In the MWM, on day 22, the animals showed no significant difference in the mean escape latency time. However, from day 23 onwards, the vehicle treated mice displayed increased proficiency at finding the hidden platform resulting in a gradual decrease in the escape latency time over days 23, 24 and 25. LPS treated mice showed impaired learning as the decrease in escape latency was significantly less than that seen with vehicle treated mice ( P < 0.001 for day 23 and P < 0.01 for days 24 and 25). Administration of TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) ( P < 0.01 for day 23, P < 0.05 for days 24 and 25) and DNP ( P < 0.01 for days 23 and 24, P < 0.05 for day 25) significantly lowered the escape latency time as compared to LPS treated mice (Fig. 2 a). In case of the probe trial, TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP treated mice spent significantly more time swimming in the target quadrant, scouting for the hidden platform as compared to the LPS treated mice ( P < 0.01, P < 0.001 respectively) (Fig. 2 b).

Y maze task
Following the MWM test, SAB (%) was analyzed in a Y-maze task. Statistical analysis by one way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey’s test revealed that SAB was significantly lower for the LPS treated mice ( P < 0.01) as compared to the vehicle control and the LPS induced memory impairment was found to be reversed by TRG administration (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 3 a) indicating that TRG ameliorates working memory deficits in LPS-injected mice. No significant change was observed in the number of arm entries between the treatment groups indicating that the improvement in behaviour has not resulted from improvement in locomotor activity.

The results are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 6) and were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test. ## P < 0.01 vs. vehicle control, * P < 0.05 vs. LPS treated group
Effect of TRG on AChE activity
AChE levels were found to be significantly higher in the LPS treated mice as compared to vehicle control group ( P < 0.001). TRG administration (50 and 100 mg/kg) caused a significant reduction in the AChE levels in a dose dependent manner in both the hippocampus ( P < 0.05 and 0.01) and cortex ( P < 0.01) respectively. DNP being a prototype AChE inhibitor also reversed the increase in AChE levels ( P < 0.01 for hippocampus, P < 0.001 for cortex) (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Effect of TRG on AChE. The results are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 6) and were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test. ### P < 0.001 vs. vehicle control, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 vs. LPS treated group
Effect of TRG on SOD, reduced glutathione and MDA activity
LPS administration elevated the in vivo oxidative stress as significantly lower values of SOD, GSH and an increase in MDA levels were observed as compared to vehicle control. Fig. 5 a illustrates that TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP administration significantly restored the SOD values for hippocampus ( P < 0.05, 0.01) and cortex ( P < 0.05, 0.001) respectively. Fig. 5 b demonstrates that TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP elevated the GSH levels in both the hippocampus ( P < 0.05, 0.01) and cortex ( P < 0.05, 0.001) respectively and reversed the elevated MDA levels ( P < 0.05, 0.01) respectively for TRG 50 and 100 mg/kg respectively and DNP ( P < 0.001) (Fig. 5 c) in hippocampus as well as cortex thus confirming their antioxidant potential.

Effect of TRG on BDNF activity
BDNF levels were significantly depleted in LPS treated mice as compared to vehicle control ( P < 0.001) in both the hippocampus and cortex. TRG and DNP treatment revived the depleted BDNF levels significantly as compared to LPS treated mice ( P < 0.05, P < 0.01, for TRG 50,100 mg/kg and P < 0.001 for DNP respectively) in case of hippocampus and cortex ( P < 0.01 for TRG 50 mg /kg and, P < 0.001for TRG 100 mg/kg and DNP) (Fig. 6 ).

The results are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 6) and were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test. ### P < 0.001 vs. vehicle control, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 vs. LPS treated group
Effect of TRG on proinflammatory cytokines i.e.TNF-α and IL-6
In Fig. 7 a, LPS treated mice showed a marked elevation in TNF-α levels as compared to vehicle control ( P < 0.001). TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP treated mice showed significantly lower levels of TNF-α as compared to LPS treated group ( P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001 for TRG 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and DNP respectively in hippocampus and P < 0.01 for TRG 50 and 100 mg/kg, P < 0.001 for DNP in cortex). Also, LPS treated mice demonstrated significant elevation of IL-6 levels as compared to vehicle control ( P < 0.001). TRG (50 and 100 mg/kg) and DNP significantly decreased the IL-6 levels as compared to LPS treated group in hippocampus as well as cortex ( P < 0.01 and 0.001 respectively) (Fig. 7 b).

Discussion
In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of TRG against LPS mediated neuroinflammation in the adult mouse brain. Several researchers indicate that LPS administration either by peripheral, systemic or intracerebroventricular route can cause impaired memory, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Choi et al. ; Qin et al. ; Hauss-Wegrzyniak et al. ). In the current study, we tested TRG in LPS induced memory impairment using two different paradigms, the Y maze and MWM. The Y maze is indicative of working memory and MWM, suggestive of spatial reference memory (Götz and Ittner ). In MWM, TRG demonstrated decreased escape latency time and increased the time spent in the target quadrant in the probe trial. Also, TRG decreased the % SAB in Y-maze. The results were comparable to that of the standard drug, DNP. Thus TRG ameliorated the memory impairment induced by LPS in both, MWM and Y maze which implies that TRG can improve both working and spatial memory. LPS administration can promote “sickness behavior” causing a decrease in locomotor activity (Dantzer et al. ). In order to ensure that there was no effect of reduced locomotor activity on memory, we analyzed the number of arm entries in the Y-maze. Our results indicated that there was no significant difference observed in the locomotor activity between the treatment groups indicating that TRG does not affect locomotor activity. Thus we can infer that the observed effects of TRG in the Y maze were due to its effects on learning and memory and not on locomotor activity.
In the course of AD progression, an extensive loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons occurs, accompanied by depletion of acetylcholine. There is evidence of elevated levels of AChE around amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD (García-Ayllón et al. ). AChE not only plays a key role in the hydrolysis of ACh, but has also been documented to assist Aβ aggregation and plaque formation (Inestrosa et al. ). Currently, inhibition of AChE has been considered the elementary way to treat AD, thereby increasing the ACh levels and improving cognition (Xiao et al. ). In our study, LPS treated mice showed significantly higher levels of acetylcholinesterase which can be correlated with the impaired memory function observed in them. Mice treated with TRG and DNP decreased the acetylcholinesterase levels. This is in agreement with previous reports of TRG possessing in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (Satheeshkumar et al. ).
LPS administration can trigger microglial activation (Noworyta-Sokołowska et al. ), which in turn induces the production of various cytotoxic substances such as proteolytic enzymes, complement proteins, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (Gonzalez-Scarano and Baltuch ). Analogously, in our current study, LPS treated mice exhibited unequivocal oxidative stress, as demonstrated by reduction in reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and increased lipid peroxidation in the mice brain. In the present study, TRG significantly mitigated the oxidative stress in LPS treated mice by significantly increasing the levels of antioxidant defence enzymes i.e. GSH and SOD and decreasing the lipid peroxidation. Other researchers have also elaborated the antioxidant potential of TRG on in vivo oxidative stress (Panda et al. ; Tharaheswari et al. ; Zhang et al. ). BDNF is a member of the classic neurotrophin family of growth factors and plays a critical role in neuronal survival, differentiation and plasticity (Tanila ). BDNF and its mRNA levels have been reported to be depleted when post mortem studies were carried out on the brain of AD patients (Phillips et al. ; Hock et al. ). There are numerous reports which demonstrate that peripheral administration of LPS can diminish BDNF levels (Guan and Fang ; Wei et al. ) and suggest that decrease in BDNF levels due to LPS administration can be correlated with chronic inflammation seen in AD patients (Guan and Fang ). In agreement with previous studies, the data from our study demonstrates that BDNF levels were decreased due to LPS administration, which was revived by TRG and DNP administration. Moreover reports indicate that decrease in BDNF levels after LPS exposure is associated with TNF-α induction (Kirsten et al. ). TNF- α has been described to play a major role in the pathophysiology of AD as there is evidence indicating overexpression of TNF-α in AD brains and elevated levels of TNF-α in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of AD patients (McCaulley and Grush ). TNF-α also diminishes learning by hampering long term potentiation, a critical process for memory (Heneka et al. ; McCaulley and Grush . Moreover, literature reports that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF- α may hinder microglial Aβ phagocytosis in AD brains thus impeding efficient plaque removal (Koenigsknecht-Talboo and Landreth ). In the present study, TNF-α levels were observed to be significantly elevated by LPS administration. Conversely, TRG at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg and DNP decreased the TNF –α levels significantly. TNF-α is a potent inducer of various other cytokines such as interleukin −1 (IL-1) and IL-6 (Ghezzi et al. ). Also, numerous authors cite that IL-6 levels are upregulated in the brain, CSF and serum of AD patients, especially locally around Aβ plaques and in animal models (Helmy et al. ; Wang et al. ). Previous experiments cite that a rise in IL-6 levels can be associated with age-related cognitive decline in humans. Further, many researchers stated that during inflammation, excessive IL-6 causes activation of neuronal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, which may undermine cognition (Wang et al. ). In this study, our investigational outcome revealed that LPS caused a rise in the IL-6 levels, which was significantly reversed by TRG treatment at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg. Thus the ability of TRG to decrease the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 implies its anti-inflammatory potential. Previously, researchers have highlighted the anti-inflammatory potential of TRG and attributed it to the decrease in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and decrease in expression of NF-κB levels (Antonisamy et al. ). It has been reported that TRG may suppress oxidative stress by inhibiting TNF-α formation. At present, NADPH oxidase is considered the most compelling source of reactive oxygen species other than mitochondria. NADPH oxidase activation, in turn causes superoxide production and thus plays a decisive rule in exacerbating oxidative stress and neuronal toxicity (Jiang et al. ). DNA microarray studies confirmed that TRG caused downregulation of the gene expressions involved with NADPH oxidase and electron transport chain and thus suppress the formation of reactive oxygen species (Yoshinari et al. ).
Conclusion
In conclusion, TRG ameliorated LPS mediated neuroinflammation and memory impairment in adult male mice brain. These results can be attributed to, increase in BDNF, reduction in the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and decrease in oxidative stress and AChE. Thus preliminary data described here indicates that TRG can exhibit beneficial effects in diseases such as AD, which have a compelling neuroinflammatory etiology. However, further studies need to be conducted to deduce the exact pathways responsible for the beneficial effects of TRG in neuroinflammation and AD.
