Introduction
The reported incidence rates of injury-related bone fracture in children vary between 1.2% and 5% depending on age, gender, and social and environmental factors [ , , , ]. The incidence typically peaks at 11–12 years in girls and 13–14 years in boys, with a male-to-female incidence ratio of 1.5:1 [ ]. The distal forearm is the most affected site, and the injury is often caused by a fall [ ]. In children younger than 2 years of age, the number of injuries is low, particularly in non-ambulatory children, with a predilection for the clavicle and skull in those younger than 8 months of age [ ]. In children 9 to 24 months of age, forearm, tibia and fibula fractures predominate [ ].
In the youngest children, physical abuse causes 12–20% of fractures [ ] and represents the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft-tissue trauma [ ]. Several studies have searched for differences between abusive and accidental fracture patterns and types, and for fractures that are pathognomonic for abuse [ , , , , , ]. To date, however, no fracture on its own is specific for child abuse [ ], although several authors have demonstrated a high association between classic metaphyseal lesions (CMLs) and non-accidental injury [ , , , , ]. Others have pointed out that normal irregularities may mimic pathology [ ]. We report the incidence of fractures due to minor/moderate trauma, including CMLs, in children ages 0–2 years, and the prevalence of metaphyseal irregularities, including the metaphyseal collar that, in some cases, may mimic pathology.
Materials and methods
From May 20, 2010, to April 1, 2015, all children between 0 and 2 years of age residing in Bergen and examined at Bergen Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department due to an injury warranting a radiograph were included. This is the only A&E department in Bergen and its surrounding municipalities that examines children with suspected fractures. The patients were identified through searches in the imaging archive system in the Paediatric Radiology Department at Haukeland University Hospital. Data on previous injury, age, gender, community (number), time interval between injury and attendance at the A&E Department, and injury mechanism were collected from the medical notes. All radiographs were taken on an Intuition DR system (Arcoma AS, Sweden) and, in a later session using a high-resolution screen, reviewed by 1–2 of 5 medical students under the supervision of a highly experienced paediatric radiologist (K.R., with more than 30 years of experience in paediatric musculoskeletal imaging), in consensus. The following features were registered: number, site and type of fractures (complete, incomplete, avulsion, fissure, crush fracture), signs of healing (periosteal new bone formation/callus [yes, no]) and metaphyseal appearances (shape: smooth contour without any steps and/or irregularities, metaphyseal collar, metaphyseal irregularity/beak/spur [Fig. 1 ], findings suggestive of injury: classic metaphyseal lesion [Fig. 2 ], periosteal new bone formation). All the assessable metaphyses included in the images were analysed.

During the study period, children with major trauma were admitted directly to the emergency unit at Haukeland University Hospital. Data on these patients were not included in the study. The number of children between 0 and 2 years of age residing in Bergen during the study period was retrieved from Statistics Norway ( https://www.ssb.no/population ). Ethical approval was waived by the Regional Ethical Committee (REK-N, no. 2012/172).
Differences in the number of metaphyseal irregularities/collars between males and females were examined using the Pearson chi-square test (2-sided), while associations between irregularities/collars and age was examined using Linear-by-Linear Association test. A P -value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) Statistics, version 25.
Results
Four hundred and eight children (212 boys, 52.0%) between the ages of 0 and 24 months (mean: 17.7 months, range: 3–24 months) were included, of whom 3 were between 3 and 6 months of age, 31 were between 6 and 12 months, 138 were between 12 and 18 months and 236 were between 18 and 24 months. Of the 408 children, 149 (77 boys) had a total of 162 fractures, yielding a fracture incidence of 5.9 per 1,000 and an incidence of children with fractures of 5.4 per 1,000. Fifty-five of the fractures (34.0%) involved the forearm, followed by leg fractures (34/162, 21.0%) and fractures to the clavicle (24/162, 14.8%). One epiphyseal separation (1/408 <24 months of age, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0–1.4%) and one metaphyseal lesion (1/34 infants <12 months, CI 1–15%) without a history of trauma were seen (Fig. 3 ).

Eight hundred and sixty metaphysis were analysed (406 in boys, 47.2%) of which 140 (16.3%) were defined as either irregular (74/860, 8.6%) or demonstrating a metaphyseal collar (66/860, 7.7%). Sixty-four out of 66 collars (97.0%) and 54 out of 104 irregularities (60.8%) were located around the wrist and the ankle, while 25/74 irregularities (33.8%) were found around the knee joint (Table 1 ). In total, there were no statistically significant differences in numbers between males and females (Table 1 ). No association between irregularity/collar and age was found for any of the metaphysis.

Discussion
We have shown a fracture incidence of 5.9 per 1,000 children younger than 2 years old with a mild to moderate trauma warranting a radiograph. No metaphyseal lesion with a history of accidental trauma was seen. In approximately 1 in 6 metaphyses, a definite collar and/or irregularity was seen, of which the majority of collars were seen around the ankle and wrist joints, while most of the irregularities were found around the wrist, knee and ankle. As for the metaphyseal findings, no differences were seen according to gender or age.
The fracture incidence of 5.9 per 1,000 compares well with that reported by Clarke and his group in 2012 [ ], namely 5.3 per 1,000 younger than 2 years old, although we did not include children with major trauma. Similar to us, they did not report any CMLs with a history of trauma [ ].
The junction between the metaphysis and the physis, or growth plate, is highly vascularised and constitutes the weakest part of the long bones in children [ ]. It is the region of enchondral, longitudinal growth. At its periphery it abuts a membraneous, one-cell thick “bone bark,” encircling the more mature portions of the growth plate and a few millimeters of the most recent growth of the metaphysis [ ]. This metaphyseal collar, first described by Laval-Jeantet et al. [ ] and later detailed by Alan Oestreich [ ], may occasionally be mistaken for a metaphyseal injury. This raises concern as the classic metaphyseal lesion is regarded a strong marker of child abuse [ , , , ]. A few critical voices say CMLs being secondary to child abuse is poorly supported, and that their histological and radiographic features are similar to healing infantile rickets [ ]. However, this view has been opposed by others, based on the radiologic appearances alone [ ], on specimens studies [ ] or in a witnessed case of CML caused by manipulation during IV placement [ ]. Recently, distal tibial CMLs have been further characterized to predominately involve the medial aspect of the bone, an observation that may further help guide radiologic diagnosis [ ].
In our study, including 81 distal tibial metaphyses, a collar involving both the medial and lateral aspects of the bone was seen in about 6% of the cases. Metaphyseal irregularities, on the other hand, seen in around 12% of the distal tibial metaphyses, were often unilateral, both those described as beaks/spurs and those resembling small avulsions. Opposite what was the case for metaphyseal collars, about one-third of the irregularities were seen around the knee joint. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the prevalence of both metaphyseal collars and irregularities in infants and young children, although the radiologic appearances have been described previously [ , ]. As the study facility was the only A&E department for minor/moderate trauma in children in need of a radiologic examination, we consider this a population-based cohort.
In our group of 408 children, one metaphyseal injury was seen in an 11-month-old boy without a history of trauma. The child was brought to the A&E with a history of refusing to use the left arm for the past few days. The radiographs revealed no evidence of a generalised bone disease. The injury was mistaken for a normal variant and no further follow-up was performed.
Limitations to our study were its retrospective nature while strengths were the high numbers, the high-quality radiographs and the meticulous analysis of images and clinical records.
Conclusion
Metaphyseal lesions with a history of trauma did not occur in otherwise healthy neonates and infants younger than 2 years of age attending the A&E Department due to a minor or moderate trauma, indicating that this type of fracture has a particular trauma mechanism. Metaphyseal irregularities/collars were frequently seen and should not be mistaken for classic metaphyseal lesions.
