Introduction
The combined use of an antibiotic, to control the pathogens, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to act against the damaging effects of inflammation, has been prescribed as a superior therapeutic approach to antibiotics alone [ , ]. Diclofenac sodium (DIC) with long-acting antibiotic [ ] and carprofen–tilmicosin (TIL) [ ] for treatment of respiratory disease of cattle and enrofloxacin–ketoprofen against a Haemophilus parasuis infection in piglets [ ] are examples of simultaneous NSAID-anti-bacterial combination.
TIL is a veterinary macrolide antibiotic used for treatment of various respiratory disorders in cattle, sheep and rabbits especially that caused by Mycoplasma spp and Pasteurella spp. Like other macrolides, TIL treatment exerts several side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, icterus and liver damage. TIL is metabolized by the liver and it is excreted in urine (24%) and in feces (68%) of cattle. Moreover, residue levels of TIL were higher in liver and kidney of swine after 7 days of treatment [ ]. Yazar et al. [ ] reported that tilmicosin was found at a high concentration in liver of mice inducing an increase in lipid peroxidation and a reduction in reduced glutathione (GSH) values. Also, TIL has a cardiotoxic effect determined by the way of administration and dosage [ ]. Positive chronotropy and negative inotropy were observed after TIL injection [ , ]. TIL cardiotoxicity was reported in dogs [ ], cattle and sheep [ ]. Youssef et al. [ ] reported that TIL induced temporary and short-term alterations of donkeys’ heart function. Farm animal producers, veterinarians and other labors may be exposed to the toxic TIL threats through wounds or direct contact with skin and mucous membranes [ ]. In human, TIL may reduce cardiac contractility, induce tachycardia and may result in death [ ]. TIL-induced cardiotoxicity is through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairment of the antioxidant enzymes system in heart tissues [ , ].
DIC is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic drug. It exerts its action through cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes inhibition, consequently hindering prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid [ ]. DIC treatment has several harmful effects on gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney and cardiovascular system [ ]. Prolonged treatment with DIC initiates or worsens congestive heart failure which may induce more serious injuries such as myocardial infarction and stroke [ , ]. DIC is metabolized by the liver, and its metabolites are eliminated through biliary (35%) and renal (65%) excretion [ ]. DIC metabolites are toxic to hepatic and renal cells [ ]. DIC toxicity was attributed to production of ROS and reduction in antioxidant defense system in liver, kidney [ , ] and heart [ ]. Excessive production of ROS initiates apoptosis process by increasing the activity of caspase-3 and restricting bcl-2 expression [ , ]. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is a pathological change included in the development of cardiomyopathy [ ]. From this point, our study was conducted to investigate the role of apoptosis in the cardiotoxicity of TIL and to assess the influence of DIC treatment on the TIL-induced cardiotoxicity in rats based on serum biochemistry, oxidative status, histopathology, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural changes with referring to their impact on liver, kidneys and lungs.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Experimental Protocol
Forty male albino rats weighing 170–275 g obtained from a colony in Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University, Egypt, were accommodated in metal cages and were fed a pelleted commercial diet with free access to feed and water. Rats were adapted 2 weeks prior starting the experiment. Rats were divided into four equal groups. The first group was kept as control. The second (TIL) group received 75 mg/kg BW tilmicosin phosphate 30% (Delta Pharma Co. Egypt) as a single subcutaneous injection [ ]. The third (TIL + DIC) group received a single subcutaneous injection of tilmicosin phosphate 30% and then injected intramuscularly with 13.5 mg/kg BW/day for 6 days diclofenac sodium (Novartis Pharma Co. Switzerland). The fourth (DIC) group was injected intramuscularly with 13.5 mg/kg BW/day diclofenac sodium for 6 days. DIC dose was the maximum daily therapeutic dose for human and was selected for rats conferring to Paget and Barnes [ ]. Animal care guidelines of National Institute of Health were followed, and ethical committee of Alexandria University permitted our study. After 24 h of treatment, animals were weighed, and five in each group were euthanized. On the 7th day from the beginning of the experiment, the remaining rats were weighed and euthanized. Collected organs (heart, lungs, liver and kidneys) were grossly examined and weighed. Index organ weight was calculated as organ weight (g)/body weight (g) × 100.
Serum Biochemistry
Just before euthanasia, blood was collected from retro-orbital plexus of the eye of each rat at the two time points of the experiment. Serum was obtained and preserved at −20 °C for biochemical analysis. Colorimetric kinetic method was performed using commercial kits (bio-diagnostics Co. Egypt) to measure serum activities of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea and creatinine levels. All biomarkers were assessed with regard to the company directions.
Assessment of Tissue Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) and Reduced Glutathione (GSH)
Heart, liver and kidney homogenates were prepared for assessment of lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH). MDA was determined through a thiobarbituric acid reaction method [ ]. Reduced glutathione content was measured according to the technique of Sedlak and Lindsay [ ].
Histopathological, Immunohistochemical and Ultrastructural Examination
Heart, lungs, liver and kidneys were collected for histopathology and rapidly fixed in neutral buffered formalin 10% for at least 24 h. Fixed specimens were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin blocks, then sectioned by a microtome (5 µm thick) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Histopathological examination of all specimens was carried out blind. Lesions were scored as follow: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. For immunohistochemical analysis, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique was used. According to manufacturer guidelines, rabbit anti-rat caspase-3 (Lab Vision, USA) and bcl-2 (DAKO, Denmark) immunohistochemistry kits were applied to recognize their expression. Five-µm-thick paraffin heart tissue sections on positively charged slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohol. For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in 10 mM citrate buffer of pH 6.0 in microwave for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was suppressed by incubating sections in 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min. Later, slides were incubated with primary antibody and then rinsed with Tris buffer saline, and the secondary antibody was applied. The 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a chromogen, and then slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Under light microscope, cardiomyocytes exhibit brown cytoplasmic staining which indicated a positive reaction to caspase-3 and bcl-2 proteins. Images of 10 fields at magnification (400×) were obtained and were analyzed using ImageJ free software to measure the area percentage of cardiomyocytes with positive staining reaction.
For transmission electron microscopy, small cubes (1 mm 3 ) of heart tissues of rat from each group were immediately fixed in 6% solution of phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 6 h [ ]. After primary fixation, tissues were rinsed in multiple changes of cold (4 °C) 0.1 M phosphate buffer every 15 min for 2 h. Samples were quickly dehydrated through ascending concentrations of ethanol, transmitted to propylene oxide and then placed in equal concentrations of propylene oxide and epoxy araldite solution overnight. Firstly, semi-thin sections (1 mm) were cut and stained with toluidine blue. Light microscopy was used to identify the areas fit for transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections (60–100 nm) were obtained by a glass knife with an LKB microtome and stained with uranyl acetate and then by lead citrate [ ]. The ultrathin sections were examined using a Jeol transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using the SAS software (version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Histopathological lesion score, an ordinal variable, was presented as mean and range. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). First, quantitative variables were checked for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk’s test, and homogeneity of variance with the Levene’s test. When data met the assumptions of analysis of variance, two-way ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of treatment and time using the GLM procedure with PDIFF option to compare means. Lesion scores along with data invalidated assumption for parametric methods were assessed with Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s post hoc test for multiple groups, and Mann–Whitney U test for differences between the two time points. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
Results
Body Weight and Relative Organs Weight
Table 1 illustrates that no significant differences were recorded in body weight of rats treated with tilmicosin and/or diclofenac; however, TIL group exhibited a significant decline in body weight on the 7th day of the experiment in comparison with the 24-h period. Regarding the relative organs weight, TIL + DIC group showed a significant difference in liver index weight on the 7th day of the study compared to control group. Kidney index weight showed nonsignificant differences among groups, but a significant difference within the TIL group between the two time points. Twenty-four hours post-treatment, TIL group showed a significant difference in heart index weight compared to control.

Table 2 indicates that in comparison with control group, the serum ALT levels exhibited a significant difference in all experimental groups at the initial period of the experiment. Serum ALT levels significantly differed in TIL + DIC group at the second time point of the experiment compared to control group. Also, serum AST levels showed a significant difference in DIC and TIL + DIC groups at the first period of the experiment compared to control. All treated groups showed a significant difference in serum AST levels at the second period of the experiment compared to control. The significant difference in all treated groups was over the time of the experiment. The serum CK-MB in addition to LDH levels differed significantly in all experimental groups compared to control group, particularly in TIL + DIC group. Serum levels of urea and creatinine showed a significant difference in all experimental groups over the time of the experiment. Marked elevation in the serum levels of urea and creatinine was noticed in TIL + DIC group. DIC group did not display significant difference in serum creatinine levels at the first period of the study.

Lipid Peroxidation and Reduced Glutathione
Lipid peroxidation (MDA) differed significantly in heart tissues of rats in all experimental groups at the two time points of comparison except TIL group on the 7th day of the experiment that did not show any significant difference (Table 3 ). Kidney MDA showed a significant difference in TIL + DIC group at the initial period of the experiment and in all experimental groups on the 7th day of the experiment. Moreover, Table 3 shows that liver MDA differed significantly in all experimental groups at the two time points of the experiment. Reduced glutathione (GSH) showed a significant difference in heart tissues of TIL and TIL + DIC rats at the initial period and in all experimental groups at the second time of the experiment (Table 3 ). Kidney GSH showed a significant difference in TIL + DIC rats on the 7th day post-treatment. Also, liver GSH values showed significant difference in tilmicosin-treated groups on the 7th day of the experiment. The significant reduction was clear in TIL + DIC group (Table 3 ).

Heart
Control heart was histologically normal at 24 h (Fig. 1 a) and 7 days of the experiment. Cardiac myofibers were branching and well organized with eosinophilic cytoplasm besides centrally located oval nuclei. At 24 h post-treatment, TIL group rats exhibited myocardial degeneration and necrosis. Lesions were slight sarcoplasmic vacuolization, fragmentation and flocculation. Multifocal areas of myocardial necrosis with mononuclear infiltrates were noticed (Fig. 1 b, c). There was congestion of the interstitial blood vessels with perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cells. DIC augmented the intensity of cardiac lesions induced by TIL (Table 4 ). There were moderate sarcoplasmic vacuolization, interstitial congestion and edema. Moreover, multifocal zones of myocardial fragmentation, flocculation, widespread necrosis with mononuclear inflammatory cells and interstitial hemorrhages were marked (Fig. 1 d). DIC group showed subtle cardiac lesions (Table 4 ). There were scattered necrotic cardiomyocytes characterized by hypereosinophilic sarcoplasm with pyknotic nuclei which were surrounded by mononuclear infiltrates. Also, interstitial congestion and edema were clear (Fig. 1 e). On the 7th day post-treatment, there were marked myocardial fibrosis in TIL group (Fig. 1 f) and perivascular mononuclear infiltrates in TIL + DIC group (Fig. 1 g). DIC group showed myocardial degeneration and necrosis with mononuclear cells infiltration (Fig. 1 h).

Lungs
Lungs of control rats at 24 h (Fig. 2 a) and 7 days of the study were of normal histoarchitecture composed of thin alveolar septa and normal bronchial and bronchiolar walls. At 24 h of the experiment, pulmonary lesions of TIL group predominantly consisted of interstitial congestion and pulmonary edema (Fig. 2 b). However, TIL + DIC and DIC groups showed congestion and moderate thickening of the alveolar septa (Fig. 2 c, d). On the 7th day of the treatment, pulmonary tissues of TIL group were nearly normal except for mild congestion (Fig. 2 e). Marked widespread edema and congestion were observed in TIL + DIC group (Fig. 2 f; Table 4 ). Pulmonary edema lessened in DIC group and was restricted to some alveoli (Fig. 2 g; Table 4 ).

Liver
Liver of control rats had regular parenchyma besides portal areas (Fig. 3 a) at the two time points of the experiment. Twenty-four hours post-treatment, liver of TIL group showed dilatation of all veins, venules and sinusoids, suggesting congestive heart failure in addition to individual cell necrosis (Fig. 3 b). TIL + DIC group showed congestion of hepatic sinusoids, venules and veins. Also, some hepatocytes had distinct border fat vacuoles (Fig. 3 c). Minute foci of hepatic cell necrosis were recorded in TIL + DIC and DIC groups (Fig. 3 d). On the 7th day of treatment, TIL group showed hepatocytic hazy border vacuoles (Fig. 3 e). TIL + DIC group showed severe various degenerative and necrotic lesions (Table 4 ). There was diffuse hepatocytic vacuolization either of sharp or hazy borders with periportal mononuclear cells infiltration (Fig. 3 f). Multifocal areas of necrosis were recorded in TIL + DIC and DIC groups (Fig. 3 g).

Kidneys
Kidneys of control rats had a normal histologic structure allover the experiment (Fig. 4 a). Twenty-four hours post-treatment, kidneys of TIL group showed congestion of the intertubular blood vessels with the presence of eosinophilic material inside the lumen of renal tubules (Fig. 4 b). Kidneys of TIL + DIC group exhibited similar lesions to those of TIL group in addition to cellular swelling of the cortical renal tubular epithelium. Moreover, few renal tubules were lined with attenuated and necrotic epithelial cells and were associated with mononuclear infiltrates (Fig. 4 c). Kidneys of DIC group showed cellular swelling of the cortical renal tubular epithelium with congestion of the interstitial blood vessels. Some renal tubules were lined with vacuolated epithelial cells (Fig. 4 d), and others contained eosinophilic materials in their lumena. On the 7th day of the experiment, TIL group displayed widespread congestion of the intertubular blood vessels besides multifocal areas of necrotic renal tubules associated with mononuclear infiltrates (Fig. 4 e). Kidneys of TIL + DIC group suffered great damage in renal epithelium that was attenuated and detached from the basement membrane of the renal tubules, and the latter were surrounded by mononuclear cell infiltrates (Fig. 4 f; Table 4 ). There were congestion and edema in the interstitium of the DIC kidneys. Also, there was a detachment of renal epithelium into the lumena of renal tubules in cortex and corticomedullary junction with interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrations (Fig. 4 g; Table 4 ).

Cardiac Ultrastructural Results
By transmission electron microscope, cardiac myocytes of control rats contained the main distributed organelles such as mitochondria, elements of sarcoplasmic reticulum, glycogen and nuclei (Fig. 5 a). Mitochondria were numerous, varied greatly in size, mostly round to oval in shape and often aggregated around the nucleus or under the sarcolemma (Fig. 5 b). Myofilaments were well organized, and typical intercalated disks were observed between the neighboring cells (Fig. 5 c). Nuclei were oval in shape and centrally located, and heterochromatin aggregated on the inner nuclear membrane. At 24 h post-treatment, tilmicosin induced some ultrastructural changes in TIL and TIL + DIC groups. These changes consisted of large vacuoles present in between mitochondria and slight corrugation of the nuclear membrane (Fig. 5 d). Normal organization of myofibrils and myofilaments with clear I-band and A-band was evident (Fig. 5 e). However, these changes progressed on the 7th day of the experiment, particularly in TIL + DIC group, in which there were major changes like enlarged mitochondria with losing of their cristae; also there were electron-dense deposits inside mitochondria (Fig. 5 f). Myofibrils degeneration was noticed which was distinguished by lysis and disorganization of myofilaments (Fig. 5 g). Myocytes nuclei showed increased corrugation of the nuclear envelope, and chromatin was aggregated around the inner nuclear membrane. Heterochromatin clumping was observed inside the nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 h). DIC group showed slight myofibrils degeneration on the 7th day post-treatment represented by corrugated nuclear membrane.

Immunohistochemistry
Cardiomyocytes immunoreactivity of caspase-3 was represented by nuclear and/or cytoplasmic brown staining (Fig. 6 A). There was a significant elevation ( P < 0.05) in area% of caspase-3 protein expression in all experimental groups at the two time points of the experiment (Fig. 6 B). Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was detected mainly as cytoplasmic brown staining (Fig. 7 A). All treated groups showed a significant reduction ( P < 0.05) in area % of bcl-2 protein expression at the two time points of the experiment (Fig. 7 B), but markedly in TIL + DIC group on the 7th day post-treatment.

Discussion
Although macrolide antibiotics are considered safe anti-infective drug, cardiotoxic impacts of tilmicosin were recorded in various animal species [ , , ]. Our study confirmed the cardiomyotoxic effects of single subcutaneous injection of tilmicosin at dose 75 mg/kg BW rat. Wherein, tilmicosin significantly elevated the serum activities of AST, CK-MB and LDH indicative of the myocardial injury compared to control group. CK-MB is the subtype of creatine kinase that has a vital role in cell energy metabolism and is considered as a definite marker for acute cardiac damage, while LDH and AST are conventionally nonspecific cardiac damage markers; so they are usually estimated besides specific markers such as CK-MB and troponin I [ , ]. The elevation of the serum levels of these biomarkers could be attributed to their leakage through the impaired cell membrane of degenerative or necrotizing cardiac myocytes [ ]. These results were previously documented by Yazar et al. [ ], Yapar et al. [ ] and Abou Elazab et al. [ ]. Additionally, these markers increased significantly in DIC-treated rats and this increase was obvious in the combined group. Similarly, increased concentration of CK-MB was reported in DIC-treated rat with an acute myocardial infarction [ ].
MDA is a by-product of lipid peroxidation and is considered to be a lipid peroxidation marker in cell membranes [ ]. In this study, estimation of MDA levels showed a significant rise in heart tissues of rats in all treated groups at the two time points except TIL group on the 7th day of the experiment that did not show significant change. MDA showed marked elevation in the TIL and DIC combined group. GSH is a major constituent of cellular antioxidant system which scavenges the detrimental effects of free radicals generated by oxidative stress [ ]. Consequently, GSH showed a significant decline in heart tissues of TIL and TIL + DIC rats at the initial period and in all treated groups on 7th day of the experiment. Yazar et al. [ ] recorded that tilmicosin induced marked changes in MDA and GSH levels at the highest dose (75 mg/kg) in the liver, but did not alter lipid peroxidation in heart tissues of Balb/C mice. Several reports documented the significant effect of a single dose of tilmicosin at 75 mg/kg on the oxidative stress in heart tissue [ , , ]. Normally, the generated ROS are balanced by endogenous cellular antioxidants [ ]. Overproduction of ROS results in disorders in cell functions and induces different pathological lesions [ ]. Recently, it has been reported that oxidative stress provoked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plays an essential role in the development of cardiovascular disease [ ]. DIC-induced cardiac damage as a result of oxidative stress was well documented by Abdulmajeed et al. [ ] and Singh et al. [ ].
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study the role of apoptosis in the cardiotoxicity of tilmicosin in rats. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was demonstrated through the down-regulation of bcl-2 expression and the increase in caspase-3 activities in the myocardium [ , ]. Caspase-3 is an executioner involved in apoptotic process. Various apoptotic inducers trigger caspase-3 results in proteolytic cleavage of other caspases and endogenous protein substrates [ ]. Caspase-3 estimation permits the detailed investigation of apoptotic mechanisms [ ]. It is well known that mitochondrial impairment is associated with cell necrosis and apoptosis. bcl-2 proteins are strictly linked to the mitochondrial membrane and are considered to be a gatekeeper to the apoptotic response. Wherein, bcl-2 proteins determine the consequence of an intrinsic apoptosis started by the liberation of cytochrome c and apoptotic factors such as caspase-9 and caspase-3 from the mitochondria [ ]. Our findings displayed a significant increase in area% of caspase-3 protein expression and a significant decrease in area% of bcl-2 protein expression in cardiac tissues of all treated groups at the two time points of the experiment. Additionally, DIC exaggerated the apoptotic process induced by TIL, particularly on the 7th day of the experiment. Initiation of apoptosis could be attributed to excessive generation of ROS [ , ]. Similarly, Jin et al. [ ] documented that isopropylarterenol induced myocardial damage through cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Moreover, the cardiotoxic effects of TIL due to its prompted oxidative stress were seen either when given alone or in combination with other cardiotoxic agents [ ]. Parallel to this, histopathological and ultrastructural findings revealed that the cardiotoxicity was noticeable in the group given both TIL and DIC. The encountered histopathological alterations were congestion, interstitial edema and the presence of mononuclear infiltrates with myocardial degeneration, necrosis and fibroplasia. Similar results were reported by Xie et al. [ ] and Abou Elazab et al. [ ]. These changes were reflected by the rise in the relative heart weight which was significant in the TIL group after 24 h of the experiment. Ultrastructural alterations were consistent with typical myocardial apoptosis and myofibrils degeneration [ ].
It is noteworthy that administration of tilmicosin at high doses induced cardiotoxicity besides hepatotoxicity [ , , ]. Occasionally, the use of diclofenac as a therapy is linked with fatal hepatotoxicity [ ]. The elevation of both ALT and AST points to the hepatocellular damage provoked by the treatments. Kart et al. [ ] reported that single dose of tilmicosin (75 mg/kg BW) injected subcutaneously induced oxidative stress in the heart, liver, kidney and lung tissues. In the current study, liver MDA was significantly increased in all treated groups at the two time points of the experiment and liver GSH levels significantly decreased in tilmicosin-treated groups on the 7th day post-treatment. These results were confirmed by histopathological examination of the livers of TIL, DIC and TIL + DIC groups as there were various degenerative and necrotic changes that were obvious in the latter group. Tilmicosin-induced nephrotoxicity was evidenced by the rise in serum levels of creatinine and urea. Similar results were described by Gheith et al. [ ]. Results revealed that the degenerative and necrotic changes were evident in treated groups, particularly on the 7th day post-treatment. Parallel to these, kidney MDA levels significantly elevated in TIL + DIC group on the first day of the experiment and in all treated groups on the 7th day of the experiment. In this study, nephrotoxicity was clear in the TIL + DIC group, particularly on the 7th day of the experiment. DIC-induced nephrotoxicity was related to ROS production, oxidative stress and marked DNA fragmentation. DIC-induced renal impairment represented by acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis was reported by Aprioku and Uche [ ].
It could be concluded that one of the possible mechanisms of tilmicosin cardiotoxicity is myocardial apoptosis. Besides its hepato-nephrotoxicity, diclofenac sodium treatment aggravated cardiotoxic effect of tilmicosin.
