Introduction
Cervical carcinoma (CC) being one of the principal causes of death among women, especially those in the prime of their reproductive lives, poses as a major health threat for the women spectrum worldwide. Globally, in 2012 alone, an estimated 528,000 instances of cervical cancer were recorded, of which around 85% of the cases occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Around 266,000 females died of cervical cancer, accounting for 7.5% of all female cancer causalities [ ]. Hence, the development of suitable techniques for early and prompt detection of CC portrays a mammoth medical challenge for individuals and health institutions alike, potentially focusing research efforts in these areas. Inspired to contribute to global medical communities’ efforts, our team suggests the use of blood-based diagnosis to detect CC.
Although tumor tissue is still the yardstick for tumor diagnosis and evaluation, chief disadvantages are engrossed in obtaining tissue samples (i.e., biopsies may be complicated and are invasive procedures). Furthermore, a tissue biopsy is often obtained from only one tumor site, and the genetics of distant metastases cannot be determined [ , ]. Despite its inconveniences, tumor biopsy remains the most dynamic diagnostic tool at present.
Human serum is acknowledged to bear minuscule extent of extracellular tumor-derived fragmented and 160–180-bp-long DNA molecules named cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) [ , ]. These are likely to originate from necrotic and apoptotic cells into the circulation [ ].
In cancer patients, ctDNA may harbor somatically derived tumor-specific mutations displaying the genomic description of an individual’s cancer, for instance single-nucleotide variations or structural rearrangements [ ]. ctDNA is therefore deemed as a genomic reservoir of different tumor clones and a good illustration of tumor genomic diversity when weighed against a single tumor sample. This inducts ctDNA a quintessential candidate for the base of a blood-based cancer diagnosis test [ ].
Nevertheless, several key advantages of ctDNA justify further investigation and development as a tool to detect tumor-specific genomic alterations in the circulation, beyond what is currently possible with tumor biopsy. First, the likelihood of ctDNA analysis even with low levels of cfDNA may result in early detection of cancer. Second, even when biopsy is technically viable, the nominally invasive, more appropriate ctDNA quantification would be more adequate to patients than biopsy. Third, ctDNA analysis facilitates monitoring of molecular alterations accompanying tumor response or acquired resistance, while sparing the patient from repeated biopsies and their probable harms.
As genetic alterations that require to be identified from ctDNA are diluted by non-tumoral cell-free DNA and non-mutated cell-free DNA (cfDNA), highly sensitive and specific detection methods are needed to provide a relatable ctDNA-based diagnosis. This concern has directed toward improvement and development of plentiful methods to investigate tumor-specific mutations in ctDNA, for instance “BEAMing” (beads, emulsions, amplification and magnetics) allele-specific PCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) [ , , ]. Although these techniques are highly sensitive, a low throughput on mutation scanning and the requisite of predefined knowledge of molecular targets to test for are their major drawbacks. Compared to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection mode, which scans for defined mutations at a specific genomic locus, NGS-based techniques allow for profiling of ctDNA at a broader range [ , ]. NGS puts forward unprecedented progress in revealing cancer genome characteristics and aiding personalized cancer therapy as a result of its exceptional precision, sensitivity and high throughput.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of somatic mutations in ctDNA, to be used as an authenticate substitute for tissue biopsies in patients with CC. Moreover, here we are also presenting an NGS workflow using a 50-gene cell-free circulating tumor DNA next-generation sequencing panel applied to a cohort of CC patients to detect tumor-specific mutations in only minute amounts of serum-derived ctDNA.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
A total of twenty-five patients ( n = 25) with histopathologically confirmed locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (FIGO stage IB–IIIB) were enrolled prospectively in the study. Written consent was obtained from each patient to allow the use of their samples for scientific research. The mean age of the complete series was 51.57 years (range 30–83 years). In all the cases, a biopsy of respective formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue was available. Demographical, clinicopathological features (stage, grade), courses of treatment(s) and vital status were acquired from the clinical and pathology reports. All the patients underwent external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) followed by internal beam radiation therapy (IBRT) according to the institutional protocol and were on regular follow-up for up to 36 months with their survival and local control being assessed consistently. In our study, it ranged from 2 to 28 months with a median survival of 19 months.
Laboratory Analysis
Sample Collection and DNA Extraction
Twenty-five venous blood samples were collected from the patients into blood collection Tube with K 3 EDTA and 4 mL of serum was obtained by centrifugation within 3 h after blood extraction at 2500 rpm at 37°C. ctDNA was extracted from 500 μL serum by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted ctDNA from each serum was eluted in a volume of 35 μL. ctDNA concentrations were measured using a fluorometric assay (Qubit ® dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Life Technologies ® , Carlsbad, California, USA). All samples provided sufficient ctDNA for NGS.
Targeted NGS-Based Gene Mutation Profiling
We designed a genetic panel consisting of genes that are key mutation hot spots and whose importance was highlighted by recent deep-sequencing studies. The selection of the genes involved a comprehensive analysis of anomalies in driver genes that are commonly mutated in breast, colorectal, ovarian, lung and other kinds of cancer. We selected genes that are frequently mutated in these tumors [ ], emphasizing on either the whole coding regions or the most highly mutated exons of these genes.
The ctDNA detected in the serum samples was sufficient to carry out NGS. Genes carrying specific somatic mutations like single-nucleotide variations (SNVs)/copy number alterations (CNAs) were screened by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using this panel.
Next-Generation Sequencing
Library preparation and sequencing: The samples were amplified using Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2, designed to amplify 207 amplicons covering approx. 2,800 COSMIC mutations from fifty oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Kit 2.0 was used to complete the libraries according to the manufacture’s instructions. The resultant libraries were subjected to emulsion PCR and prepared for sequencing by Ion PI™ IC 200 Kit (Life Technologies) using Torrent Suite Software™.
Clinically significant somatic mutations were differentiated from germline polymorphisms by comparing against several SNP databases and by their interpretation in COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer; http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic ).
To Screen Somatic Mutations in Tumor Tissue
For the analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples, DNA was purified from four 5.0-mm-thick unstained FFPE sections according to the standard DNA FFPE tissue protocol and the gene mutations were screened by NGS targeting 50 cancer genes (Table 1 ). To rule out the germline mutations and to correlate with ctDNA, relevant statistical test was exercised.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The correlation among the quantitative variables was evaluated with simple linear regression analysis. The Chi-square test was used, and Pearson’s Chi-square P < 0.005 was considered to be statistically significant difference.

Patients Detected with ctDNA
The median ctDNA concentration found in serum was 23.3 ng/mL (range < 0.2–96.0 ng/mL). Overall, we detected genetic alterations in genes of 21 (84%) patients’ ctDNA out of 25. The mean genetic alteration was 4.08 (2–14). In 4/21 (19%) patients, more than eight genomic alterations were detected, another 4/21 (19%) patients had 5–7 genetic alteration and the remaining 13/21 (61.9%) patients showed less than four genetic alterations (Fig. 1 ).

SNVs Detected
Out of 50 genes, 32 genes were detected in our patients. As given in Table 3 , the most common SNVs detected were TP53 -11/21 (52.3%) patients, CDKN2A -10/21 (47.6%) patients, PIK3CA -9/21 (42.8%) patients, PTEN and STK11 -7/21 (33.3%) patients, BRAF and VHL -6/21 (28.5%) patients, EGFR and SMAD4 -4/21 (19%) patients, CTNNB1 , GNAS , KIT , APC , PIK3CA -3/21 (14.28%) patients, SMARCB1 , SMO , RET , FBXW7 , ERBB2 , CSF1R , CDH1 , AKT1 , ATM , EBB4 , FGFR3 , FLT3 , HRAS , JAK3 , MET , NOTCH1 , NPM1 , KRAS , PTPN11 -1 or 2/21(4.7 to 9.5%) patients. Table 3 Individual genetic alteration frequency in patients Individual genetic alterations—SNV ( n = 21) TP53 11 (52.3%) CDKN2A 10 (47.6%) PIK3CA 9 (42.8%) PTEN , STK11 7 (33.3%) BRAF , VHL 6 (28.5%) EGFR , SMAD4 4 (19%) CTNNB1 , GNAS , KIT , APC 3 (14.28%) SMARCB1 , SMO , RET , FBXW7 , ERBB2 , CSF1R , AKT1 , ATM , CDH1 , ERBB4 , FGFR3 , FGFR3 , FLT3 , HRAS , JAK3 , MET , NOTCH1 , NPM1 , KRAS , PTPN11 1–2 (4.7–9.5%)
In combination with the aforementioned genetic alterations, BRAF , CDKN2A , EGFR PIK3CA , PTEN , STK11 , TP53 and VHL genes had the main alterations, and in combination with these genes, at least one genetic alteration among combination was found in 100% patients at any point of time as summarized in Fig. 2 . Thus, this gene panel can be used as a diagnostic genetic module. Fig. 2 Combination of genetic alterations in BRAF , CDKN2A , EGFR , PIK3CA , STK11 , TP53 and VHL genes
In our study, we found that with an increase in the stage, the number of genes expressed amplified (Table 4 ). Further, patients’ survival data were collected for 36 months from hospital files and by phone calls. It was found that among patients with genetic alterations, 12 were alive (all completed treatment) and 9 were dead (cancer-related) (7 completed treatment). Survival ranged from 2 to 28 months with a median survival of 19 months. It was found that most of the deaths occurred in advance stage (IIB–IIIB).

Another important finding was that patients with changes in APC , ATM , BRAF , CDKN2A , CSF1R , EGFR , FLT3 , HRAS , JAK3 , KIT , PTEN , PTPN11 , STK11 , TP53 and VHL genes were found to have a more aggressive disease than those minus the abovementioned (Table 5 ).

Discussion
In the present study, we have devised a module consisting of 50 malignancy-associated genes with a perspective of designing a minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic tool for CC patients. Provided the method to detect somatic mutations in serum ctDNA, targeted sequencing by NGS has already displayed its efficacy in clinical practice and translational research for several solid tumors or lymphoma [ , ].
In our analysis, out of twenty-five patients, twenty-one were detected with genomic alterations in ctDNA by sequencing with the targeted panel. Of these patients, four individuals had more than eight genomic alterations, another four patients had 5–7 genetic alteration and the remaining thirteen patients harbored less than four genetic alterations in ctDNA. Out of 50 genes, 32 genes were detected in our patients. As given in Table 3 , the most common SNVs detected were TP53 -11/21 (52.3%) patients, CDKN2A -10/21 (47.6%) patients, PIK3CA -9/21 (42.8%) patients, PTEN and STK11 -7/21 (33.3%) patients, BRAF and VHL -6/21 (28.5%) patients, EGFR and SMAD4 -4/21 (19%) patients, CTNNB1 , GNAS , KIT , APC , PIK3CA -3/21 (14.28%) patients, SMARCB1 , SMO , RET , FBXW7 , ERBB2 , CSF1R , CDH1 , AKT1 , ATM , EBB4 , FGFR3 , FLT3 , HRAS , JAK3 , MET , NOTCH1 , NPM1 , KRAS , PTPN11 -1 or 2/21 (4.7 to 9.5%) patients. These data depict that TP53 coding for p53 is the common mutation occurring in cervical cancer patients followed by mutations in CDKN2A and PIK3CA as summarized in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Genes that are frequently mutated in cervical cancer
On merging the abovementioned genetic alterations, BRAF , CDKN2A , EGFR PIK3CA , PTEN , STK11 , TP53 and VHL genes had the main alterations and on grouping of these genes, at least one genetic alteration among combination was found in 100% patients at any point of time as shown in Fig. 1 . Thus, we conclude that this gene panel can be used as a diagnostic genetic module.
The detection rate (21/25, 84%) was similar to another study that included patients suffering from secondary brain tumors: 24/27 (88.8%) in a cohort of high-grade glioma patients. Among our genetic module STK11 (55.5%), TP53 (44.4%), PTEN (44.4%) and VHL (33.3%) are associated with bad prognosis, i.e., death/progression of disease. VHL is the most specific gene, and STK11 is the most frequent bad prognostic gene.
Also, we found that with an increase in the stage, the number of genes expressed increased (Table 4 ). This analysis substantiates the liquid biopsy concept, as a minimally invasive diagnostic test. Furthermore, NGS may be used as a molecular diagnostic method ahead of delivering targeted therapies allowing for the detection of specific alteration in a targeted manner.
Conclusion
Our outcome on a consistent cohort of patients advocates that targeted NGS for the detection of somatic mutations in ctDNA could be applicable clinically for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The genetic alterations in BRAF , CDKN2A , EGFR , PIK3CA , PTEN , STK11 , TP53 and VHL genes are the main alterations and the combination of these can be used as a genetic module and at any point of time, at least any one genetic variation among this genetic module was found in 100% carcinoma cervix patients. This can be a future directive toward crafting a feasible, repeatable, faster, cost-effective and highly predictable diagnostic tool for early screening/diagnosis.
