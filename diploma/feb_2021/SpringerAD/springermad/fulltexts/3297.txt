INTRODUCTION
Over a number of decades, lung cancer has become one of the most severe diseases that threaten human life ( , ). In spite of the tremendous efforts made to improve early diagnosis or chemotherapy/radiation therapy, much remains to be done. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies and drugs are urgently required for the treatment of lung cancer. Gambogic acid (GA) is a polyprenylated xanthone isolated from the gamboge resin of the Garcinia hanburyi tree. Previous investigations have demonstrated that GA can inhibit the proliferation of a variety of malignant cells, including lung cancer ( ), hepatoma ( ), leukemia ( ), gastric carcinoma ( ), and breast carcinoma ( ) in vitro and in vivo . It has also been reported that GA exhibits low toxicity in normal tissues ( , ). Although some studies have suggested that GA could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for various cancers, the limitations of its low solubility (less than 0.5 μg/ml), short half-life (less than 1 h in dogs and less than 20 min in rats) and wide distribution in vivo remain to be addressed ( ). Currently, L-arginine or Cremophor EL is used as a solubilization agent for the intravenous injection of GA. However, some undesirable toxic effects have been reported, such as hypersensitivity reactions, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity ( , ).
A successful cancer therapy needs to kill tumor cells effectively, accumulate well in tumors rather than in non-target tissues, and improve patients’ quality of life. However, the reality is the opposite: the clinical use of many chemotherapeutic agents reveals their poor pharmacokinetics and serious side effects. This obstacle can be potentially overcome by using a targeted drug nanodelivery system and a large number of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have been studied and developed by scientists, including liposomes, polymers, micelles, and antibodies ( , , , ), which have the potential for effective cancer treatment.
Among the different technologies described until now for the design of anticancer drug nanocarriers, albumin nanoparticles have attracted considerable interest compared with other approaches because they have several unique features, such as good biodegradability, lack of toxic and antigenic effects, good stability, a long shelf life, and extraordinarily high drug binding ( ). The first human serum albumin-based nanoparticle formulation, ABI 007 (Abraxane®), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005. Abraxane is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that involves 130-nm albumin-bound (nab™) technology, and which has been shown to have superior antitumor efficacy compared with paclitaxel in animal and clinical studies. Albumin can bind the hydrophobic paclitaxel well, and thus be a substitute for the Cremophor EL used in Taxol®, and it has been shown to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions significantly. Furthermore, it is believed that human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles are actively transported across the endothelium of blood vessels via 60-kDa glyco-protein (gp60) and caveolae-mediated transcytosis, and they exhibit increased retention in the tumor interstitium by association with secreted protein acidic-rich in cysteine (SPARe) ( ).
Inspired by the success of nab-paclitaxel, the aim of this study was to prepare GA-loaded albumin nanoparticles to take advantage of the therapeutic effect of GA and reduce its side effects. The GA-HSA nanoparticles (NPs) were produced based on nab-technology in order to increase the aqueous solubility of GA, and improve its stability and therapeutic efficacy when administered intravenously. In this study, the optimal parameters that control nanoparticle synthesis were investigated. In addition, these nanoparticles were characterized by examining their morphology, particle size, release properties, stability, and antitumor activities in vivo .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
GA (purity >93%) was kindly supplied by Jiangsu Kanon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (China). Human albumin (HSA, 65 kDa) was purchased from Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. Other chemicals and reagents used were of analytical or chromatographic grade. The animals used in this study were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center (Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China). All animal procedures described were evaluated and approved by the University Ethics Committee for the use of laboratory animals and in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals were treated humanely throughout the experimental period.
Preparation of GA-HSA NPs
GA-HSA NPs were prepared using nab-technology. Briefly, 1 ml samples of HSA solutions (20% w / v ) were dissolved in 9 ml water and the pH was adjusted to 5.6∼6.4 with citric acid. Separately, 30 mg GA was dissolved in 1.25 ml of mixed organic phase containing various organic solvents (e.g., ethyl acetate, acetone, methylene chloride, chloroform, acetone, or tetrahydrofuran). These two solutions were then mixed and subjected to probe sonication (Sonics & Material Vibra Cell, 750 W, 20 kHz). The sonication was performed at 300 W (on 2 s, stop 1 s) in an ice-water bath for 6 min and the resulting colloid underwent rotary evaporation to remove the ethyl acetate and acetone at 40°C for 15 min under reduced pressure. The nanoparticles obtained were then passed through a 0.22-μm membrane syringe filter, and lyophilized without any cryoprotectant, and stored at 4°C until required.
Characterization of GA-HSA NPs
Particle Size and Zeta Potential
The average particle size was measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), using a Nicomp™ 380 Particle Sizing system (Zeta Potential/Particle Sizer NICOMP™ 380ZLS, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The GA-HSA NPs were measured at a temperature of 25°C and a scattering angle of 90°. Variance (P.I.) was used to measure the particle diameter distribution. The P.I. and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were determined at 25°C using the same instrument.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a Shimadzu SSX-500 field emission SEM (Tokyo, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. GA-HSA NPs powder was coated on to double-adhesive conductive tape which had been applied earlier to a copper stub.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a G 2 20 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Samples were dropped on to a carbon copper grid, then excess solution was removed by blotting the grid with filter paper. The grid was then incubated in phosphotungstic acid (1.5% w / v ; pH 7.0) for 5 min and air-dried at room temperature in a desiccator containing silica gel for 24 h.
Loading Capacity, Filtration Efficiency, and Entrapment Efficiency
To determine the GA loading efficiency and filtration efficiency in nanoparticles, 1.0 ml GA-HSA NPs was dissolved in 50 ml acetonitrile and sonicated for 30 min to extract GA completely. The obtained solution was passed through a 0.22-μm pore-size millipore membrane and subjected to HPLC. The HPLC analysis was carried out using a system consisting of an L-7100 pump, an L-7200 autosampler, an L-7420 UV detector (Hitachi Company, D-7000, Japan), and a Agilent TC-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Agilent Technologies, USA). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.5% phosphoric acid (90:10, v / v ) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the column temperature and wavelength of the UV detector was 25°C and 360 nm, respectively ( ). To determine the encapsulation efficiency in nanoparticles, the free GA in the nanoparticle was separated by ultracentrifugation using a Hitachi ultracentrifuge (CS120GXL), and the sample was centrifuged at 257,000× g for 2 h, and then diluted with acetonitrile and the GA concentration in the solution was measured by the HPLC analysis as described above. The GA loading capacity, filtration efficiency, and entrapment efficiency were calculated using the following equations: $$ \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{A}{\textstyle \hbox{-}}\mathrm{loading}\kern0.35em \mathrm{capacity}\left(\%\right)=\mathrm{weight}\kern0.35em \mathrm{of}\kern0.35em \mathrm{G}\mathrm{A}\kern0.35em \mathrm{entrapped}\kern0.35em \mathrm{in}\kern0.35em \mathrm{G}\mathrm{A}{\textstyle \hbox{-}}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{S}\mathrm{A}\kern0.35em \mathrm{N}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{weight}\kern0.35em \mathrm{of}\kern0.35em \mathrm{G}\mathrm{A}{\textstyle \hbox{-}}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{S}\mathrm{A}\kern0.35em N\mathrm{P}\mathrm{s}\times 100\%\\ {}\mathrm{Filtration}\kern0.35em \mathrm{efficiency}\left(\%\right)={W}_{\mathrm{out}}/{W}_{\mathrm{in}}\times 100\%\\ {}\mathrm{Encapsulation}\kern0.35em \mathrm{efficiency}\left(\%\right)=\left({W}_{\mathrm{total}}-{W}_{free}\right)/{W}_{\mathrm{total}}\times 100\%\end{array} $$
Where W in and W out were the weight of GA before and after passage through a 0.22-μm pore-size millipore membrane, respectively. W total and W free were the total GA and the free GA in the nanoparticle solution, respectively.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the samples was performed using a Thermal Analyzer-60WS, DSC-60 (Shimadzu). GA, HSA, a physical mixture of GA and Lf, and GA-HSA NPs were heated from ambient temperature to 300°C at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, 4 mg of each sample was analyzed in a closed aluminum pan and aluminum oxide was used as a reference.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. About 2 to 3 ml of each sample was mixed with dry potassium bromide and scanned over the range of 4000–400 cm −1 .
X-Ray Diffraction Studies
X-ray diffraction was used to investigate crystalline (or amorphous) phases for GA, blank HSA, GA-BSA NPs, and the mixture of GA and HSA. The patterns were obtained on a Magix Pro PW2440 X-ray diffractometer, with a tube of Cu K α radiation in the diffraction range of 5–60° at a voltage of 40 kW and current of 30 mA.
In Vitro Release of GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg Solution
One milliliter of GA-HSA NPs or a GA-Arg solution (equivalent to about 4 mg GA) was dialyzed (MWCO14 kDa, Shanghai Green Bird Science & Technology Development Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) against 10 ml of release buffer (pH 7.4 PBS with 0.5% ( w / w ) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 30% and 40% ethanol). The in vitro release experiments were carried out in a mechanical shaking water bath maintained at 37°C and 100 rpm ( , ). Periodically, 10 ml of samples of the release buffer was removed and replaced with the same volume of fresh buffer. The amount of GA was finally determined by HPLC under the same analytic conditions as described above. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The results of triplicate measurements were used to calculate the cumulative drug release.
Stability
Dilution Stability
To investigate the change in GA-HSA NPs in the human body after intravenous administration, GA-HSA NPs were diluted 2-, 8-, 32-, and 100-fold with 5% HSA at 37°C. GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg solution were diluted with pH 7.4 PBS or physiological saline to determine the change in content. The dilution stability of GA-HSA NPs was characterized by comparison with the initial particle size, P.I, content, and physical appearance. The dilution stability of GA-Arg was characterized by comparison with the initial content and physical appearance.
Storage Stability
To investigate the long-term stability of GA-HSA NPs, two kinds of conditions were used. Firstly, according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), GA-HSA NPs were stored at 25°C and 60% RH. Secondly, GA-HSA NPs were stored at about 4°C. Freeze-dried GA-HSA NPs were reconstituted with 0.9% sodium chloride and kept under the above two conditions, respectively. The storage stability was evaluated in terms of the appearance, particle size, P.I, and filtration efficiency.
In Vivo Antitumor Activity
The therapeutic effect of GA-HSA NPs was determined using male SCID mice inoculated subcutaneously with the 4 × 10 6 A549 human lung cancer cell line. When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm 3 , the mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups ( n = 6): group 1 was given human serum albumin solution, group 2 was given an intraperitoneal injection of cabazitaxel (2 mg/kg), group 3 was given an intravenous injection of GA-HSA NPs (GA 2 mg/kg equivalent), and group 4 was given an intravenous injection of GA-Arg solution (GA 2 mg/kg equivalent). The mice received these injections twice at an interval of 7 days. The experiment was terminated when all the mice in either the control or treatment group died. The tumor volume was measured every other day with calipers in two dimensions and calculated as equation I below. The slope of the tumor volume-time curve, representing the growth rate of each tumor in the treatment group, was obtained for 19 days in a row after injection. The relative tumor volume (RTV) and the growth inhibition rate (TGI) were calculated using equation II and equation III, respectively. Also, the T/C index of the growth rate for the in vivo therapeutic effect in the tumor-bearing mouse model was calculated using equation IV. In addition, the survival (%) was obtained by dividing the number of surviving mice by that of the initial number of mice. At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.
Equation I: Tumor volume (mm 3 ) = longer diameter × (shorter diameter) 2 × 0.5
Equation II: RTV = V t / V 0 ( V 0 = the tumor volume before treatment, V t = the tumor volume after treatment)
Equation III: \( \mathrm{T}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{I}=\left[{V}_{\mathrm{t}\left(\mathrm{control}\right)}-{V}_{\mathrm{t}\left(\mathrm{test}\right)}\right]/{V}_{\mathrm{t}\left(\mathrm{control}\right)}\times 100\% \)
Equation IV: T/C (%) = TRTV/CRTV × 100% (TRTV = the RTV of the treatment group, CRTV = the RTV of the control HSA group)
In summary, the antitumor activity was assessed by three evaluation criteria, RTV, T/C, and TGI. Moderate activity was defined as a T/C% ≤ 40% and a TGI% value of 40% or more, as well as significant differences in RTV between the treatment groups and the negative control group.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of more than three experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the statistical significance of differences among groups. Statistical significance in the differences of the means was determined using Dunnett’s test for single or multiple comparisons of the experimental groups, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Preparation and Parameter Optimization of GA-HSA NPs
GA-HSA NPs were prepared using nab-technology, as shown in Fig. 1 . HSA solution and the organic phase were mixed in a probe sonicator leading to the formation of a large amount of droplets around GA, which improves its poor solubility. The HSA was also absorbed to stabilize the small droplets and to reduce their sedimentation rate in aqueous media. Subsequently, superoxide ions produced by sonication can lead to oxidation of the sulfhydryl residues of HSA to form new disulfide bonds and produce a crosslinked structure. The organic phase containing GA was incorporated into nanoparticles in the form of a non-continuous phase. Then, the suspension underwent rotary evaporation to remove the organic phase and produce solid nanoparticles. It was noted that, in nab-technology, the formation of nanoparticles depends on crosslinked disulfide bonds; however, in chemical crosslinking, the BSA NPs were solidified by a condensation reaction using a reagent containing an aldehyde group ( , , ). In order to obtain GA-HSA NPs with a high drug loading and narrow particle size distribution, a variety of preparation parameters were investigated in this study. It was found that the pH of the HSA solution, the organic solvents, the power and time of sonication, and the temperature of the rotary evaporation had an effect on the properties of the nanoparticles, such as the particle size, filtration efficiency, and stability. Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the formation of GA-HSA NPs. The chemical structure of GA and crystal structure of HSA are shown. The subdivision of HSA into domain (I–III) and subdomains is indicated, and approximate drug binding sites site I and site II (hydrophobic part) are conceived
Effect of pH
The effect of pH on the particle size, zeta potential, P.I., and filtration efficiency of NPs was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, b , when the pH ranged from 5.6 to 6.4, the filtration efficiency, P.I, particle size, and zeta potential were about 84.52 ± 8.5%, 0.028 ± 0.001, 134.8 ± 3.3 nm, and −20.8 ± 4.4 mV, respectively. A larger particle size was produced when the pH was outside the range 5.6∼6.4, and this may be related to an insufficiently negative repulsion of the particles in suspension. Moreover, the pH had an influence on the conformation of HSA and the interaction between the drug and HSA. Firstly, HSA undergoes a major reversible conformational isomerization with changes in pH. The standard conformation “N” is present at a neutral pH, while conformational changes occur above pH 8. This “N” conformation might produce a slightly higher affinity for hydrophobic molecules which are suitable for GA loading ( ). Secondly, most organic molecules, such as anticancer agents, and antibiotics, are bound to sites I and II in HSA, as shown in Fig. 1 , by hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. Close to pH 6.0, most GA (pKa 7.8) molecules are present in undissociated form instead of anions and, therefore, the hydrophobic effect may be the main interaction between GA and HSA. Fig. 2 a Influence of the pH of the HSA solution on the filtration efficiency and P.I.; b influence of the pH of the HSA solution on the particle size and zeta potential
Effect of Organic Phase
The organic phase plays an important role in the formation of nanoparticles. The organic phase destroys the aqueous layer around the HSA during the preparation process, and the GA molecules dissolved in the organic phase are incorporated into the HSA NPs before rotary evaporation. As shown in Fig. 3a , the nanoparticles produced by the mixed organic phase had a lower particle size and higher filtration efficiency than pure ethyl acetate. Acetone and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are miscible with water, and this may contribute to the high drug incorporation into HSA and the good stability during storage. However, when methylene chloride and chloroform were used as a mixed organic phase, the nanoparticles became unstable during storage. Taking the toxicity of the solvents into consideration, ethyl acetate and acetone (ethyl acetate/acetone = 4:1 ( v / v )) were selected as the organic phase. As shown in Fig. 3b , the optimal oil-water ( w / w ) ratio was 1:8. When the organic phase ratio was reduced, the drug concentration in the organic phase increased. The amount of HSA absorbed could not stabilize the new interface, leading to merging of the nanoparticles. When the organic phase ratio was increased, small droplets could merge or be precipitated during the removal of the organic phase, resulting in a higher distribution and lower filtration efficiency.

Preparation Process Parameters
The particle size was affected by the preparation process parameters, such as the power or length of sonication, and the temperature of the rotary evaporation. As shown in Fig. 4a, c , the optimum length of sonication and power was 6 min and 300 W (on 2 s, stop 1 s), respectively. The sulfhydryl residues of HSA were oxidized and/or existing disulfide bonds were disrupted by superoxide ions produced by a chosen sonication time and power. Excessive or insufficient sonication energy may completely denature the HSA or produce unsuitable deformation and insufficient crosslinking, so that GA cannot be completely incorporated into the nanoparticles. Similarly, the stability of HSA NPs was also affected by the temperature of the rotary evaporation. As shown in Fig. 4b , with an increase in temperature, the stability of the HSA NPs decreased, especially in the presence of organic solvents, and this is because the organic solvents can damage the aqueous layer around the HSA. Thus, a larger particle size and low filtration efficiency were obtained when the temperature of the rotary evaporation was 50 and 60°C. However, the time of rotary evaporation was prolonged when the temperature of the rotary evaporation was lower than 40°C, and this led to small droplets merging into larger droplets. Therefore, the most suitable temperature for rotary evaporation was 40°C.

Characteristics of GA-HSA NPs
GA-HSA NPs had a particle size of 135.2 ± 35.03 nm, and a narrow distribution with a P.I. of 0.023. A narrow particle size distribution could weaken the saturation solubility difference and inhibit Ostwald ripening ( ). The zeta potential of GA-HSA NPs was −21.81 ± 1.24 mV, which prevented the agglomeration of NPs because of the strong negative electrostatic repulsion. It is generally believed that a zeta potential of −20 to −40 mV is sufficient to maintain a stable formulation with both electrostatic and steric stabilization ( ). The nanoparticle morphology is shown in Fig. 5a, b , and GA-HSA NPs appeared spherical in shape with a relatively narrow size distribution. The particle size obtained from SEM and TEM measurements was smaller than those obtained from PCS. This can be explained by the fact that the PCS data showed particles swelling in the aqueous phase while SEM and TEM show images of the dried particles. The loading capacity of the nanoparticles was 11.02 ± 0.19%, and the filtration efficiency and entrapment efficiency was 92.4 ± 4.4 and 99.3 ± 3.2%, respectively. Fig. 5 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images ( a ) and transmission electron microgram (TEM) images ( b ) of GA-HSA NPs
The State of GA in Nanoparticles
The interaction between GA and HSA was studied by DSC and FT-IR. DSC thermograms (Fig. 6 -1) showed exothermic peaks of GA and HSA at 73.58 and 213.8°C, respectively. For the physical mixture, peaks at 73.58 and 213.8°C were simultaneously observed. However, the lyophilized GA-HSA NPs showed no characteristic exothermic peaks, which suggested that GA might be present in molecular form or in an amorphous state in the nanoparticles. The FT-IR analysis of HSA, HSA processed by sonication, GA, GA-HSA NPs, and the physical mixture of GA and HSA are shown in Fig. 6 -2. In Fig. 6 -2a and 2b, characteristic absorption bands were observed at 1656.0 and 1540.3 cm −1 , and these were assigned to the C=O stretching vibration of the acetyl group (amide I) and the N-H bending vibration (amide II), respectively. For GA (Fig. 6 -2c), characteristic absorption bands were found at 2970.7 and 2925.7 cm −1 , which were associated with the O-H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group. Compared with the FT-IR spectrum of A, B, C, and E, no new absorption bands were found in the structure of GA-HSA NPs (Fig. 6 -2d), indicating that no chemical bond was formed between GA and HSA. The crystalline (or amorphous) phases of GA in HSA NPs were investigated by obtaining X-ray diffraction spectra. As shown in Fig. 6 –3, there were three characteristic crystal peaks of GA, at 11°, 18.5°, and 20°, while the crystal peak of HSA was around 23°. Some crystal peaks, especially at 11° in GA, which appeared in the mixture of GA and HSA, had disappeared in GA-HSA NPs. A new and low intensity peak at 24° appeared in the GA-BSA NPs, which indicated that GA was dispersed in a molecular or amorphous state in the nanoparticles.

In Vitro Release of GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg Solution
The release of the GA from the nanoparticles and GA-Arg solution was investigated by dialysis at 37°C, and the pH 7.4 PBS medium contained 0.5% ( w / w ) SDS or 30∼40% ethanol, since ethanol has been proven to reduce the absorption of GA by dialysis bags and improve the release profile ( ). The results given in Fig. 7 show that in pH 7.4 PBS with 0.5% SDS, the release of GA from NPs and arginine solution was below 10%, indicating that the sink condition was not satisfied or too much GA had been adsorbed by the dialysis bag. When the release medium changed to PBS with 30 or 40% ethanol, the GA release profiles was improved significantly. Approximately 57.4 and 68.9% GA was released from the nanoparticles in pH 7.4 PBS medium containing 30 and 40% ethanol within 72 h, whereas 89.9 and 92.7% GA was released from GA-Arg solution in PBS medium containing 30 or 40% ethanol. The slower GA release from NPs compared with GA-Arg solution was due to the hydrophobic interactions between GA and HSA which reduced the release of GA to some extent, and the incorporated GA took longer to be released from NPs. The initial burst release was from the surface adsorption of GA, and then the incorporated GA was released from inside the NPs. The in vitro drug release data suggested that GA-HSA NPs exhibited better sustained release than GA-Arg solution. Fig. 7 Release profiles of GA from GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg solution in the medium of pH 7.4 PBS with 0.5% SDS, 30 or 40% ethanol within 72 h, the hollow circle and square represent GA release from GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg solution in the pH 7.4 PBS with 0.5% SDS, respectively. The solid square and triangle represent GA release from GA-HSA NPs in the pH 7.4 PBS with 30 or 40% ethanol, and the solid diamond and circle represent GA release from GA-Arg solution in the pH 7.4 PBS with 30 or 40% ethanol
Stability
Dilution Stability
Considering the intravenous administration of GA-HSA NPs, it was necessary to investigate the physicochemical properties during their transportation in blood. Generally, NPs with a positive charge tend to interact with plasma components and form aggregates, resulting in an increase in particle size compared with that of negative NPs ( ). In this study, it was found that GA-HSA NPs showed no obvious increase in size when diluted with 5% HSA from 2- to 100-fold, as shown in Fig. 8b , because of their negative surface charge. Although the P.I. of NPs increased to almost 0.1 with an increase in the dilution ratio, the value still remained within an acceptable range. The results obtained suggested that GA-HSA NPs are physically stable in the blood circulation. The chemical stability of GA in NPs and GA-Arg solution diluted with pH 7.4 PBS and normal saline (NS) was compared and the results are shown in Fig. 8a . The content of GA-Arg in pH 7.4 PBS and NS was reduced by 29.3 and 14.6% after 6 h, respectively, while that of GA-HSA NPs remained constant over 24 h. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that GA was stable in an acidic environment, but was degraded in an alkaline environment. The pH of GA-Arg solution diluted with pH 7.4 PBS and NS was more than 8 while that of GA-HSA NPs was less than 7. Fig. 8 a The stability of GA-HSA NPs and GA-Arg in pH 7.4 PBS and physiological saline; b The effect of different x -fold dilutions; c the image of freeze-dried GA-HSA NPs; d the image of GA-HSA NPs reconstituted with water
Storage Stability
GA-HSA NPs were stored at 25°C in 60% RH and 4°C in a refrigerator. After 12 months, the freeze-dried GA-HSA NPs showed no collapse or shrinkage, and they could be reconstituted within 1 min in 2.0 ml purified water or normal saline, as shown in Fig. 8c, d . The reconstituted NPs possessed a particle size of 134.8 ± 34.02 nm, a zeta potential of about −21.48 ± 1.08 mV, and a high entrapment efficiency, and there was little change in the physicochemical properties compared with those before storage. In addition, GA-HSA NPs could be stored in aqueous suspension for more than 8 weeks without any significant changes at 4 and 25°C with 60% RH. However, the GA-Arg solution, our potential drug for use in clinical trials, was clearly unstable under the same storage conditions. Thus, freeze drying is an effective way to achieve long-term storage stability without the use of excipients, because HSA acted as a “water replacement” and helped reconstitution ( ).
In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy
The antitumor activity of each treatment group was evaluated in A549-bearing mice, and the average tumor growth rate is shown in Fig. 9a . Also, the RTV, T/C, and TGI monitored for 19 days are shown in Table I . As shown in Fig. 9a , the tumor growth rates in mice treated with GA-HSA NPs or GA-Arg solution were markedly retarded, and GA-HSA NPs were more efficient than GA-Arg solution in suppressing tumor growth. As shown in Table I , the RTV and T/C in the GA-HSA NPs group were comparable with those in the cabazitxel group, which were lower than those in the GA-Arg solution group after 19 days’ treatment. In addition, the TGI of the GA-HSA NPs group was approximately 1.25-fold higher than that of the GA-Arg solution group. Furthermore, the change in body weight as a function of time in the tumor-bearing animals was used as a marker of safety. As shown in Fig. 9b , compared with that in control group, weigh losses were seen in the cabazitxel and GA-Arg solution groups, and the animals showed some behavioral changes such as decreased activity, bradypnoea, crouching, and tail swelling, while there was no serious body weight loss in mice treated with GA-HSA NPs. Moreover, GA-HSA NPs produced a higher survival rate compared with GA-Arg solution as shown in Fig. 9c . The survival (%) of the GA-Arg solution group was 33.3% at day 19, which was significantly lower than the 83.3% in the group treated with GA-HSA NPs. In addition, compared with GA-Arg solution, the animals in the GA-HSA NPs group required a shorter time to resume normal activity, and showed no significant tail necrosis during the treatment period. These results suggested that GA-HSA NPs not only inhibited A549 tumors more effectively but also produced less toxicity, which was probably due to their long circulation time and EPR effect. Accordingly, GA-HSA NPs have more potential to treat cancer compared with the current clinical trial agent (GA-Arg solution).

CONCLUSIONS
A major disadvantage of hydrophobic drugs is their low water solubility and poor pharmacokinetic profiles which, in turn, can contribute to adverse effects and low therapeutic efficacy. GA is a potential anticancer drug, which is limited by its poor solubility, and arginine is added in clinical applications, producing a variety of side effects. In this study, the GA-loaded HSA NPs were prepared using nab-technology to improve the solubility and in vivo distribution. GA was dispersed in a molecular or amorphous state in the NPs, and no new chemical bond was formed between GA and HSA. The in vitro drug release of GA-HSA NPs showed a more sustained release than GA-Arg solution. A stability study revealed that GA-HSA NPs exhibited no changes in particle size and filtration efficiency when stored in an aqueous suspension for up to 8 weeks and after freeze-drying for up to 12 months. Moreover, the chemical stability of GA in HSA NPs was higher than in GA-Arg solution when diluted with pH 7.4 PBS or normal saline. In the treatment of A549-bearing mice, the TGI of the GA-HSA NPs group was approximately 1.25-fold higher than that of the GA-Arg solution group, and the survival (%) in the GA-HSA NPs group was higher than in the GA-Arg group. In all, GA-HSA NPs have been shown to be an effective drug delivery system for tumor therapy.
