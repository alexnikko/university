Introduction
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent congenital disorder in newborn and the most common cause of infant death from birth defects when infectious etiologies are excluded [ , ].
The etiopathogenesis of CHD is complex and not completely understood. Genetic factors have been recognized for a long time as the predominant cause of CHD, although only ≈ 15% of CHD cases can be traced to a known cause of inheritance [ , , ].
Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies over the last years indicates that environmental factors contribute to CHD risk [ , ]. In particular, several studies demonstrated a strict interaction between parental environmental exposure and genetic capability to metabolize environmental toxicants in increasing CHD risk [ , , , , , ].
Most interestingly, recent studies in mouse embryonic stem cells have revealed the crucial role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway during heart development, where AhR is also a potential target of environmental agents that can cause departure from the cardiovascular homeostasis leading to cardiac malformations [ , , ]. Specifically, Carreira and colleagues demonstrated that the activation of AhR by its toxic compounds affected the cardiomyocyte differentiation by disrupting the expression of NKX 2-5, a key transcription factor required during early cardiogenesis, and its target genes also essential for heart development, with resultant congenital heart defects [ , , , ].
The AhR is known to mediate the ligand-dependent induction of xenobiotic metabolism programs, controlling the toxicity of environmental compounds, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo(a)pyrene [ ]. When bound to xenobiotic environmental ligands, AhR translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), contributing to the activation of target genes (mostly Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes) by binding to the AhR-responsive element (AHRE) in their promoter region.
The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AhR gene is known to negatively affect the affinity and sensitivity of the AhR protein as well as the activation of the AhR-signaling pathway, influencing the susceptibility to various human diseases, probably including cardiovascular disorders [ , ]. However, to date, no evidence is available about the role of AhR polymorphisms in human CHD risk.
The p.Arg554Lys (rs2066853; c.1661G > A) polymorphism is the most studied SNP in the human AhR gene, consisting in a G > A substitution in exon 10, causing an arginine to lysine substitution in its transactivation domain. It is remarkable that the AhR p.Arg554Lys has also been suggested, in combination with polymorphisms of some cytochrome P450-metabolizing enzymes, as a reliable genetic biomarker of so-called environmental - sensitivity - related illnesses [ ].
Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of AhR p.Arg554Lys polymorphism in patients affected by CHD, as well as to analyze its joint effects with parental exposure in modulating CHD susceptibility.
Methods
Study Population
This case–control study included 128 patients (76 males; age 6.2 ± 6.7 years) with a diagnosis of isolated non-syndromic CHD, including ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle and transposition of great arteries. The cardiac diagnosis was confirmed by one or more of the following procedures: echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and/or surgical intervention. A control group of 274 (160 males; age at birth) newborn healthy children without any congenital malformations was also enrolled. A sample of peripheral blood was collected before transfusion from CHD patients, whereas a cord blood sample was obtained from healthy newborns.
Data Collection
Both case and control parents completed a structured questionnaire on demographic, preconceptional and lifestyle exposures, as previously described [ ]. Briefly, the paternal questionnaire carefully evaluated the period of 3 months before conception, based on the duration of spermatogenesis (about 70 days). The maternal questionnaire covered the period before conception to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. The first trimester of pregnancy was based on the fact that it is the most critical period for embryogenesis associated with an increased sensitivity to environmental factors. Both questionnaires gathered information on personal characteristics, lifestyle habits, health, pregnancy aspects, medication during pregnancy, occupational history and potential harmful exposures. In particular, we derived environmental and occupational exposure data from specific questions on potential teratogens/mutagens that have been linked to human reproductive impairment, including exposure to industrial cleaning agents and solvents, pesticides, paint/varnish/thinner, asbestos, chemicals, anesthetics, dioxins and dioxin-like compounds and heavy metals, hazardous waste sites and landfills. Maternal illness data included diseases of the thyroid, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary disorders and mental illness. Moreover, the prolonged use of specific drugs (e.g., psychotropic drugs, anticonvulsants, exogenous female hormones) that have been linked to fetal cardiogenesis impairment has been considered. Additionally, we considered as smokers those who smoked at the time of conception and during the 6 months before the study inclusion; those smokers who had stopped smoking more than 6 months before the study inclusion and who had never smoked were defined as non-smokers.
The study was conducted with informed consent from parents of each participant in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the local ethical research committee approved it (Study No. 436, 19/09/2013).
Genotyping Assays
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using a DNA isolating kit (Qiagen, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and quality were evaluated by a NanoDrop Lite Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA), and an absorbance ratio at both 260 and 280 nm (A 260 /A 280 ) greater than 1.6 was considered suitable for the analysis.
Allelic discrimination for the AhR p.Arg554Lys polymorphism was completed by real-time PCR using the C_11170747_20 TaqMan ® Drug Metabolism Genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems, USA). Negative and positive controls were included as a quality control measure. PCR assay contained 2.5 µl TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (2×), 0.25 µl TaqMan genotyping assay mix (20×) (Applied Biosystems), including two probes labeled with FAM and VIC fluorescence dyes, and 1–20 ng DNA. The PCR cycling conditions consisted of one 10-min cycle at 95 °C and 40 PCR cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Genotyping results were analyzed by allelic discrimination assay of CFX Manager ® software (Bio-Rad). For quality control, 10% of samples were further genotyped by Sanger DNA sequencing and the concordance was 100%.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses of the data were conducted by using the Statview statistical package version 5.0.1 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). All determinants were dichotomized except for the age variable. Given the relatively small number of exposed parents in any particular environmental or occupational category, the statistical analysis for toxicant exposure included both environmental and occupational exposures. Each risk factor was coded as either present or absent. The smoker group combined the past and current smokers.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Differences between the means of two continuous variables were evaluated by the Student’s t test. Chi-square test was used to test for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and to compare allelic and genotypic frequencies between groups. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of the AhR Arg554Lys polymorphism and parental exposure with the presence of CHD. The ORs were also adjusted for potential confounding factors. Each genotype was assessed according to dominant and additive genetic models. Interaction terms were also introduced in the models to examine the interaction of genotypes with exposure. Interaction p values were calculated by likelihood ratio testing, comparing the model with main effects for each covariate (polymorphism and exposure) to the model including the cross-tabulation of the two covariates. Power calculations showed that the study sample was able to detect an association between AhR Arg554Lys allele and CHD with OR het ranging from 2.5 to 3.0, based on a 15% MAF in the case–control study. Additionally, the study was powered to allow a gene–exposure interaction of magnitude 3–4 with at least 80% power and an error rate of 5% [ , ]. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Parental Exposure
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of mothers, fathers and children are listed in Table 1 . Both mothers and fathers of CHD patients had a significantly lower age than controls ( p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Children affected by CHD were more often conceived with in vitro fertilization ( p = 0.02). Paternal smoking ( p = 0.04), maternal periconceptional exposure ( p = 0.001) and paternal periconceptional exposure ( p = 0.002) were significantly higher in CHD cases with respect to control newborns.

Genotypes Distribution of AhR p.Arg554Lys and CHD Risk
The genotype distribution and allele frequencies of AhR p.Arg554Lys are listed in Table 2 . The genotype ( p = 0.001) and allele ( p < 0.0001) distributions of AhR p.Arg554Lys differed significantly between patients and controls. The observed genotype frequency was in agreement with that expected under the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( p > 0.05). The AhR p.Arg554Lys polymorphism was related to nearly a threefold and sixfold increased CHD risk in the dominant and the additive genetic models, respectively (Table 2 ). Table 2 AhR p.Arg554Lys genotype and allele distribution Genotype No. (%) of cases ( n = 128) No. (%) of controls ( n = 274) OR (95% CI) p value Arg/Arg 68 (53) 211 (77) 0.001 Arg/Lys 50 (39) 58 (21) Lys/Lys 10 (8) 5 (2) Lys allele frequency 0.27 0.12 < 0.0001 Model Additive (Arg/Arg vs. Arg/Lys vs. Lys/Lys) 6.2 (2.0–18.8) 0.001 Dominant (Lys/Lys and Arg/Lys vs. Arg/Arg) 2.9 (1.9–4.6) < 0.0001
Gene–Environment Interactions
When applying the dominant model, the results of the interaction analysis of AhR Lys-554 allele in conjunction with parental smoking and periconceptional exposures are shown in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively.

The simultaneous presence of AhR Lys-554 allele and maternal periconceptional exposure lead to almost sixfold increased risk compared with those of genotype without exposure as measured by odds ratio (OR exposure = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8–3; OR allele = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.5–4.5; OR interaction = 5.7; 95% CI = 2.6–12). Regarding paternal influence, the simultaneous presence of risk allele and smoking habit lead to almost fivefold increased risk to CHD (OR smoking = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.9–2.9; OR allele = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3–5; OR interaction = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.4–9.9).
Discussion
The present study showed that both maternal and paternal environmental factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of offspring with CHD, reinforcing the notion of a multifactorial etiology for the most common congenital malformations. Additionally, our findings clearly demonstrated that the p.Arg554Lys genetic variant in the AhR gene is a strong genetic risk factor for CHD, with an almost sixfold increased risk of p.Arg554Lys carriers. This study provided also evidence of an interactive effect between this SNP and paternal smoking as well as maternal periconceptional exposure to toxicants.
Comparison with Previous Studies
Our findings confirm and extend the findings from previous investigations, showing that the occurrence of heart defects is a result of the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors, including both maternal and paternal exposures [ , , , , , ].
To the best of our knowledge, the present investigation is the first one to consider the relationship between the AhR p.Arg554Lys SNP and CHD in humans.
Our genetic findings indirectly corroborate recent experimental studies, showing that ablation of the AhR as well as its activation by exogenous ligands disrupt the molecular networks involved in heart formation and function, including the signaling network regulated by the transcription factor NKX 2-5 [ , , , ].
Several polymorphisms have been discovered in the AhR gene so far, which result in a different individual sensitivity to toxic insults, and thus may be related to toxicant exposure-induced diseases [ , ]. These AhR genetic variants may alter the AhR activity and have an impact on receptor-mediated drug metabolism, resulting in different binding affinities or more functional forms, thereby making their carriers more sensitive to environmental compounds exposure [ , ].
Among the AhR polymorphisms, the p.Arg554Lys (rs2066853) missense variant is the first discovered SNP of human AhR gene and the most widely studied in the adverse health effects. The Lys-554 allele has been associated with a lower AhR mRNA expression and an altered expression of AhR target genes, such as CYP1 proteins, also involved in the metabolism of noxious compounds [ , , , ].
Additionally, a recent study tested the likely effects of the SNP by several in silico analyses, giving proof of its deleterious effects on the secondary protein structure, altering the characteristics of the binding domain where the polymorphism is located [ ]. Consequently, p.Arg554Lys genetic variant seems to have an impact on the structure and function of the encoded protein affecting the AhR function [ , , ].
Nevertheless, the association between p.Arg554Lys and health risks remains controversial. For instance, although numerous studies have associated this SNP with an increased risk of a variety of cancers, others did not support these associations [ , , ]. These inconsistent findings across studies may be due to several factors, including different ethnic populations, small sample size and study design issues [ , , ].
To date, only few studies have investigated the association between the p.Arg554Lys polymorphism and toxicants parental exposure as well as its potential impact on children’s development.
Specifically, a study reported that pregnant women with the AhR Lys-554 allele had higher dioxin levels than those with the AhR Arg/Arg genotype, suggesting different dioxin accumulation in the body of mothers which would lead to different dioxin exposure levels [ ]. However, there was no association of non-syndromic oral clefts with p.Arg554Lys in a cohort of 148 Japanese patients [ ].
Our findings demonstrated that the AhR p.Arg554Lys polymorphism increases the risk of CHD and also synergistically acts with parental smoking and toxicant exposures to increase the CHD risk.
The association between the SNP alone and the CHD could be attributed to the role that AhR plays in maintenance of cellular homeostasis, often in the absence of xenobiotic ligands [ ]. Indeed, AhR -null mice show an impaired cardiovascular phenotype and cardiomyocyte differentiation, underscoring a critical role for the receptor in the complex regulatory target network essential for cardiogenesis and cardiovascular homeostasis [ , ].
Additionally, the increased risk of CHD in the concomitant presence of both SNP and exposure is in agreement with experimental evidence, showing that AhR pathway disrupts cardiomyocyte differentiation whether Ah receptor is further activated by the agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -doxin or inhibited by antagonists or short-hairpin RNA [ , ].
Study Limitations
Our findings must be considered in the light of certain limitations. Firstly, all the risk factors studied were self-reported; thus, random misclassification of exposure and recall bias could not be excluded. However, recall bias seems not be frequently present in case–control studies on congenital malformations [ , ]. Secondly, no information regarding maternal outdoor secondhand smoking exposure in pregnancy was available. Moreover, the sample size limited our ability to examine specific environmental and occupational exposures. Another limitation of our study is the lack of a more comprehensive genetic analysis of polymorphisms in the AhR gene. Finally, the underlying molecular mechanisms as well as their consequences on the expression of AhR target genes implicated in the metabolic detoxification pathways were not investigated.
Conclusion
In summary, our findings showed that the functional AhR p.Arg554Lys genetic variant, alone and in combination with parental exposure, is associated with the CHD risk, highlighting the significant role that Ah receptor plays in the cardiovascular development. Validation studies in a relatively larger sample and other ethnicities are warranted.
