Introduction
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) refers to clusters of life-threatening infections, cancers, and wasting symptoms. Initially, Kaposi’s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia are the two disease indicators when AIDS was first reported in the spring of 1981 among groups of homosexual men living in New York City and California [ , , , , ]. In the same year, persistent defects of cell-mediated immune function characterized by decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, T cell counts, and lymphocyte proliferation were found in community-acquired pneumocystis carinii pneumonia occurred between 1979 and 1981 among 11 young men who were drug abusers and homosexuals [ ]. In 1983, an American research group led by Gallo [ ] and a French research group led by Luc Montagnier [ ] independently declared that a novel retrovirus, later renamed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), might have been infecting people with AIDS. Thirty-five years later, the relationship between HIV and AIDS remains controversial [ ]: (1) HIV is the cause of AIDS, a theory proposed by Gallo [ , ] and Montagnier [ ]. (2) HIV is just a passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS, a hypothesis claimed by Duesberg [ , ]. And (3) all the available data cannot prove the existence and role of ‘HIV’ in the development of AIDS, an argument made by the Perth Group [ , , ].
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published the list of AIDS-defining clinical conditions as a guideline for AIDS diagnosis [ ]. Typical clinical manifestations are opportunistic infections, severe loss of the body weight, Kaposi’s sarcoma, fever, and symptoms. Most of the AIDS-defining clinical conditions result from persistent deficiency of innate immunity and cellular immune dysfunction. In fact, low CD4 cell counts and depressed CD4 cell function are predictive of an essential failure of cell-mediated immune system [ , , , ]. Therefore, AIDS has the characteristics of cell-mediated immune defects.
Intriguingly, the immunodeficiency in AIDS is mutually associated with autoimmunity. Indeed, AIDS has characteristics of both immunodeficient disorders and autoimmune diseases. First, patients living with AIDS show the excessive humoral immune response defined by the presence of a variety of antibodies and circulating immune complexes [ , , , , ]. Second, autoimmunity in AIDS is also evident by therapeutic benefits of immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation [ ] and bone marrow transplantation [ , ] in AIDS and HIV-infected patients. Third, several clinical trials have shown that HIV vaccines aiming at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibody responses to block HIV infection have yet far from success [ , , , ], principally due to the underestimation of the autoimmunity. Last, deficit of regulatory T cells (Treg) has implicated in the autoimmunity of AIDS patients [ , ]. In this review, we present the immunological characteristics of AIDS with focusing on autoimmunity and Treg. Since normal metabolism maintains immune homeostasis and metabolic disturbances have strong impacts on autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and infection [ , , , , ], we also explore the role of dysmetabolism in the development of AIDS-related immunological hallmarks (Table 1 ). Table 1 Immunological hallmarks of AIDS Hallmarks Characteristics Hallmarks of natural immunity Damage of defense barriers such as skin, mucosa, and blood vessels [ , , , ] Damage of metabolic homeostasis manifested as fever, cold, diarrhea, and loss of body weight [ , , ] Hallmarks of cell-mediated immune deficiency Deficiency in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes [ , ] Deficiency in macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells [ , , , ] Low function and low frequency of regulatory T/B cells [ , ] Hallmarks of autoimmunity Cytotoxic T cell self-destruction due to regulatory lymphocyte deficit [ ] B lymphocyte proliferation and response due to regulatory lymphocyte deficit [ , ] Autoantibodies produced by expanded B lymphocytes [ , , , , ] Cytokines, growth factors, and complement complex released from activated cells [ , ] Hallmarks of lymphoid tissues Lymph node enlargement, lymphoma, leukemia [ , , ] Hallmarks of neoplasms Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia, cervical cancer and conjunctival cancer [ , , , ] Hallmarks of opportunity infections TB, HBV, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, oral, and esophageal candidiasis [ , , , , , ] Hallmarks of sense organ damage Eye disorders [ , ] Hallmarks of treatment-induced events Immune reconstruction inflammatory syndrome, toxic effects such as lipodystrophy and metabolic disorders [ , , , ] Hallmarks of risk factors Homosexuals, heroin users, recreational drug addicts and blood transfusion recipients [ , , ]
Regulatory T cells
Treg are a specialized subpopulation of CD4+ T cells for controlling the activation and expansion of immune cells to suppress immune responses. In conditions, such as infection and cancer [ , ], Treg prevent excessive immune destruction by modulating host immune responses [ ]. Thus, Treg play an important role in the development of autoimmunity and maintenance of immune homeostasis [ ]. Potential regulatory mechanisms underlying the Treg function are summarized in Table 2 [ ]. In theory, Treg may serve the interface of too little of cell-mediated immunodeficiency and too much of antibody-mediated humoral immunity in the AIDS-defining clinical conditions. Table 2 Regulatory T cell-mediated regulatory mechanisms Suppression by inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β [ ] Suppression by cytolysis through the secretion of granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin [ , ] Suppression by metabolic disruption through the consumption of IL-2 and production of adenosine and cAMP [ , , ] Suppression by dendritic cells through the modulation of their maturation and function [ , ]
Deficit in the frequency of regulatory T cells
CD4+CD25+ are the cell-surface transmembrane proteins for the characterization and isolation of Treg [ ]. CD25, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-α, binds to IL-2 to facilitate the expansion of Treg population [ ]. Patients with AIDS have depressed CD4+CD25+ Treg [ ] as well as decreased IL-2 levels [ ]. All of these findings indicate that low Treg counts result in autoimmunity in AIDS.
Deficiency in the function of regulatory T cells
Foxp3 is the major transcription factor for the immunosuppressive activity of Treg [ , , ]. Several studies have revealed a decreased expression of Foxp3 in human autoimmune diseases [ , , ]. Similarly, AIDS patients have depressed CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg [ ]. Furthermore, the Treg in AIDS patients show the deficiency in the production of inhibitory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β [ ]. Taken together, AIDS patients have the compromised function of Treg to predispose to autoimmunity.
Toll-like receptors and regulatory T cells
Human toll-like receptors (TLR) are a growing family of type I transmembrane proteins for immune homeostasis. Interestingly, TLR2 and TLR4 are the two members expressed in human Treg to enhance the Treg proliferation [ ] and immunosuppression [ ]. The decreased TLR4 expression in AIDS/HIV infection is an important predisposing factor to autoimmune disorders [ ].
In summary, defects of Treg in AIDS are evident by the low cell count, low Foxp3 expression, low production of the inhibitory cytokines, and low TLR expression. All these defects predispose to the occurrence and persistence of autoimmune disorders manifested in AIDS-defining clinical conditions.
Autoimmunity in AIDS patients
Autoimmunity in AIDS patients is generally underestimated and is sometimes even neglected. In contrast, too much attention and too many efforts have focused on the cell-mediated immunodeficiency in AIDS patients. We have spent billions and billions of dollars on HIV vaccines without acknowledging the pivotal role of autoimmune in the development of HIV infection and AIDS. AIDS represents a syndrome of autoimmune disorders rather than immunodeficiency per se [ ]. Autoimmune mechanism has long been recognized in the development of AIDS and HIV infection [ , , , ]. Here, we summarize the main points highlighting the autoimmune-related mechanisms of the AIDS-defining clinical conditions (Table 3 ). Table 3 Autoimmunity in AIDS Excess of humoral immunity B lymphocyte proliferation and B cell lymphoma [ , , ] Autoantibodies produced by expanded B lymphocytes [ , , , , ] Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyosits, Graves’ disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and arthritis in AIDS patients [ , , ] Improvement of HIV infection with solid organ transplantation Kidney transplantation [ ] Cardiac transplantation [ ] Combined kidney and pancreas transplantation [ ] Combined kidney and liver transplantation [ ] Improvement of HIV infection with stem cell transplantation [ , ] Failure in clinical trials of HIV vaccines [ , , , , ] Elevated cytotoxic T cells [ , , , ]
Excess of humoral immune response
B lymphocyte hyperactivation, elevated levels of immunoglobulins [ , , ] and immune complexes, and the presence of autoantibodies [ ] are three lines of compelling evidence for overreaction of humoral immune response. Autoantibodies in the sera of AIDS patients include antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-erythropoietin antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-β2 GPI, anti-DNA, anti-small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP), anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-myosin, and anti-cardiolipin [ , , , , , ]. Consequently, the excess of humoral immune responses predisposes AIDS patients to a wide range of autoimmune disorders. The AIDS-related autoimmune disorders comprise systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anti-phospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, polymyosits, Graves’ disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, acute nonspecific arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, and inflammatory myositis [ ]. The relation of B lymphocyte expansion and autoantibody overproduction in HIV-infected patients to clinical autoimmune disease to AIDS-defining clinical conditions has yet to be established.
Improvement of HIV infection with solid organ transplantation
People with HIV infection and AIDS are at a risk of end-stage organ failure, involving end-stage organ failure in myocardiopathy, renal and liver diseases [ ]. Solid organ transplantation is often the choice for these patients to survive. Interestingly, a HIV-infected patient without any anti-viral treatment had limited viral replication and stable CD4+ T cell counts 4 years after kidney transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy [ ]. Consistently, the good clinical outcome, stable CD4+ cell counts and suppressed HIV viremia have been found in HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive persons with cardiac transplantation [ ], combined kidney and pancreas transplantation [ ], kidney and liver transplantation [ ]. In fact, several transplant centers have reported encouraging clinical and laboratory outcomes before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [ , , , , ]. Intriguingly, the most frequently prescribed immunosuppressant drug for organ transplantation, cyclosporine A, inhibits HIV replication and improves autoimmune disorders in HIV-infected patients [ , , , ]. All these findings provide solid evidence for the autoimmunity in AIDS and HIV infection.
Improvement of HIV infection with stem cell transplantation
In 2007, the ‘Berlin patient,’ a 40-year-old white man with 10-year history of HIV infection and newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, underwent two courses of induction chemotherapy and one course of consolidation chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic stem cell–cell transplantation with CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA-identical donor who had been screened for homozygosity for CCR5 δ32 allele [ ]. The patient also received immunosuppression with cyclosporine, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin and a single dose of whole body irradiation. No active, replicating serum HIV was detected 40 months after the discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy [ ]. Interestingly, antibodies to polymerase as well as the capsid proteins and frequency of HIV-specific T cells were also undetectable after transplantation and immunosuppression [ ]. Unfortunately, none of other six recipients received a graft from homozygosity for the CCR5 δ32/δ32 mutation has survived for longer than 1 year [ ], and in the case of a 27-year-old patient with HIV-1 infection and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, HIV-1 rebounded rapidly after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [ ]. In July 2012, two ‘Boston patients,’ who received stem cells without the protective mutation, also had undetectable levels of HIV in their blood on antiretroviral treatment [ ]. Likewise, the ‘Boston patients’ experience HIV rebound off antiretroviral treatment [ , ]. Among the factors accounting for the encouraging outcomes of the ‘Berlin patient,’ disappointments of the ‘Boston patients’ and high mortality of the other six ‘Berlin patients’ after stem cell transplantation, autoimmunity and immunosuppression are essential to HIV infection, cancer and AIDS.
Failure in clinical trials of HIV vaccines
Since the report that HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS in 1984, huge research efforts and global investments have focused on developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection. More than 30 years have been passed, tested vaccines including the gp160 subunit vaccine against HIV genes and proteins [ , ]. Vaccine designers use DNA, live viral and bacterial vectors, viral proteins or viral peptides, and virus-like particles [ ]. The vaccine approaches can be active and passive immunization using isolates or prime–boost combinations [ ]. Disappointing results have happened in landmark clinical trials of HIV vaccination such as the Merck’s STEP trial [ , ], Thailand Clinical Study [ ], and Step Study [ , , ]. The genetically engineered recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine even has increased risk of HIV infection [ , , ]. The elevated risk of HIV acquisition seen in the Ad5 seropositive men becomes absent in Ad5 seronegative men [ ]. Hazard for HIV infection is prominently high in individuals who at the baseline have high titers of the plasma antibodies against the immunogen. People at a risk of HIV infection already have too much antibodies for autoimmune disorders, and a vaccine designed to boost immunity to HIV can worsen the autoimmune conditions. This is the most important point rather than the challenge for HIV vaccination [ ]. In summary, all the setbacks for trials to develop an HIV vaccine indirectly highlight the pivotal role of autoimmune mechanism underlying the development of HIV infection and AIDS.
Elevated cytotoxic T cells
One of the immunological hallmarks of AIDS and HIV infection is the increased CD8–CD4 ratio. As the first line of defense against virus infection, the function and number of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes have elevated in HIV seroconverters, HIV seropositive men, and AIDS patients [ , , ]. Elevated cytotoxic T cells have broad actions of immune activation and autoimmune self-destruction in response to HIV infection [ , , ]. Therefore, the elevated cytotoxic T cells also reflect the autoimmunity in HIV infection and AIDS.
Potential autoantigens and self-antigens
Table 4 shows potential autoantigens and self-antigens that induce autoimmunity in AIDS-defining clinical conditions. Recently, the dense fine speckled protein of 70 kDa (DFS70), also known as lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGFp75), is regarded as an enigmatic autoantigen at the interface between autoimmunity, AIDS, and cancer [ ]. Table 4 Proposed autoantigens and self-antigens that induce autoimmunity Catabolism Protein fragments and cleavage products from apoptotic CD4+ T cells [ , ] Blood cells lytic materials from platelets, neutrophils, and red cells [ ] Molecular mimicry HIV [ ] HIV-1 protein Nef [ ] AIDS-related opportunistic pathogens [ , , , , , , ] Donated blood cells or debris from blood cells [ , , , ] Undigested food [ ] Hapten from incompletely digested food Undigested bovine serum albumin antigen [ , ]
Catabolism
The high level of apoptosis and destruction of CD4+ T cells is a hallmark of AIDS and HIV infection. Substantially increased release of protein fragments and cleavage products from apoptotic CD4+ T cells are potential self-antigens stimulating the production of autoreactive cytotoxic T cells [ , ]. The presence of autoreactive cytotoxic T cells is indicative of autoimmune destruction [ ]. Additional autoantigens include cell debrises and lytic materials derived from platelets, neutrophils, and red blood cells in combination with nonspecific adherent immune complexes [ ]. Excessive catabolic activities produce potential autoantigens in AIDS-defining clinical conditions.
Molecular mimicry
Molecular mimicry is a proposed mechanism relating to the genesis of autoantigens. Defined as that the exogenous antigens and microbes may have molecular similarity to the normal cells, molecular mimicry can induce cross-reaction and result in autoimmune self-destruction therefore. For example, there is a common structure pattern between the sequences of HIV-1 protein Nef and β-chain of the HLA class II histocompatibility antigens [ ]. Other self-antigens that have homologies with HIV include Fas protein, CD4+ T cell receptor (TCR), the variable regions of TCR α-, β-, and γ-chain, and several functional domains of IgG and IgA [ ]. Microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites living in AIDS individuals, also release autoantigens through molecular mimicry [ ].
Blood transfusion increases the risk of HIV infection and AIDS [ , , , ]. The donated blood products could be potential autoantigens, assuming to the similar structure with normal cells.
Remarkably, AIDS patients suffer from digestive disorders. The digestive disorders favor the production of IgA and IgM in the gut mucosa secretions [ ]. These mucosal antibodies interact with dietary protein fragments, leading to enhanced intestinal permeability and formation of IgG and IgA in the blood against dietary proteins and peptides. The undigested protein or peptide sequences of food, such as milk, are similar to those of human molecules, predisposing to autoimmune response to different target organs, tissues and cells [ ].
Hapten from incompletely digested food
People with AIDS commonly have problems in digestion. Poorly digested food nutrients present in circulation act as haptens for potential autoantigens. The haptens consist of protein fragments, small peptides, polysaccharides, lipoproteins, and even enzymes that may induce autoimmune response. For example, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with deposition of IgM and C3 are observed in AIDS patients [ ]. The presence of anti-bovine serum albumin antibody and undigested bovine serum albumin antigen originated from cow’s milk in circulation plays a putative role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as glomerulonephritis and immune nephropathy [ , ].
Dysmetabolism
Dysmetabolism plays a critical role in the development of AIDS and infections. The manifestations of metabolic disturbances could present clinically as early, middle, and late stages of AIDS.
Weight loss
Weight loss is one of the most common metabolic disorders in AIDS patients and may occur at each stage of the disease. In 1987, the USA CDC classified wasting as an AIDS-defining condition. The wasting syndrome characterized by weight loss is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in AIDS [ , ]. Mortality rate in the first 6 months is seven times higher than that of after 6 months when pertaining to having AIDS-related weight loss [ ]. On the other hand, our prior study has revealed that the regaining of body weight during the treatment predicts favorable long-term survival and normal living capability in Chinese patients with AIDS [ ]. Therefore, weight loss is presumably as an indication of poor prognosis in patients with HIV infection and AIDS.
Digestion symptoms
Patients with AIDS commonly experience digestive problems. Although the problems of digestion symptoms are not life threatening, severe metabolic abnormalities, such as weight loss, occur progressively if left untreated. The gastrointestinal disorders include oral lesions, esophageal lesions, diarrhea, and anorectal diseases. Diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain are the most frequent complaints presenting clinically as early-, intermediate-, and late-stage illness [ , ]. These disorders are closely related to hypoalbuminemia, malnutrition, weight loss, and wasting condition, creating further negative impacts on an already compromised immune system with subsequent susceptibility to infection.
Fever
Fever remains to be a common dysmetabolic disorder among patients with AIDS. In fact, fever can occur at any time points during the disease [ ]. Fever is present in 50–90 % of AIDS cases, often accompanied by significant morbidity and prolonged hospitalization [ , ].
Before the HAART era, fever is often caused by opportunistic infectious agents such as mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma. With the advent of HAART, fever also occurs in concomitant with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [ ], neoplasm and adverse drug reactions [ ]. Therefore, fever remains as the challenge for the management of AIDS patients.
Metabolic disturbances
Patients with AIDS often have metabolic disturbances in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids [ ]. Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are common in AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy [ , , ]. The antiretroviral treatment also induces lipodystrophy characterized by hyperlipidemia, central obesity, and benign symmetric lipomatosis [ , ]. Furthermore, disturbances in protein metabolism occur with wasting, progressive weight loss, and increased protein turnover [ ]. All these metabolic disturbances can lead to wasting, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, and high mortality in AIDS patients [ ]. Although the exact mechanism underlying metabolic aberrations remains unclear, infections, immune dysfunction, and antiretroviral treatment play important roles [ ].
Criteria for cure of AIDS
A cure for AIDS is captured as a global priority of investigation. Based on the theory that ‘HIV causes AIDS,’ patients from HIV RNA copies, antigens and associated antibodies should be considered as ‘cure’ [ ]. A functional cure for HIV infection is defined by undetectable viremia, symptoms relief, and lack of HIV transmission without antiretroviral therapy. So far the ‘Berlin patient’ has HIV free for 6 years [ ]. Alternatively, most doctors and patients believe that relief from suffering of AIDS-defining conditions outweighs reduction in blood HIV viral load [ ]. Since the diagnosis of HIV infection is based on seropositivity of HIV antibodies [ ], the ultimate cure for HIV infection is determined by long-term complete eradication of HIV and total disappearance of plasma HIV antibodies. This point also highlights the critical role of autoimmunity in HIV infection and AIDS.
Summary
Autoimmunity and immunodeficiency are the two sides of the AIDS coin. Optimal treatments favor therapeutics targeting on dual regulation of both immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. An important lesson we have learnt from the failure in clinical trials of HIV vaccines is that the critical role of autoimmunity in the development of AIDS and HIV infection cannot be ignored. Concerning the close interactions between metabolism, immunity, and infection, therapeutic approaches should focus on restoring the metabolic and immunological homeostasis.
