Introduction
Molecules within a fluid are exposed to attractive forces by all the surrounding molecules. In a homogeneous fluid continuum, the sum of the resulting forces is zero and no intermolecular force related–tension is generated. Contrarily, the surface of a fluid that borders a physico-chemically distinct compartment—as exemplarily the air-water interface—naturally exhibits substantial surface tension. This is mostly the result of inherently formed hydrogen bonds between dipolar water molecules, which cannot evenly be formed at the air-water interface. As a consequence, a highly attractive net force results, which pulls molecules towards the inside of the fluid and causes its surface to contract and bead up [ ]. This phenomenon naturally also occurs in physiological fluids like tear fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although its impact is considered most significant for the alveolar fluid [ , ]. Accordingly, the tight regulation of surface tension and viscosity is of crucial importance for proper physiology, most importantly for respiratory function [ ].
Surface tension and its pathologic alterations accompanying distinct diseases were studied extensively in the lungs. Here, the pulmonary surface active agent (surfactant), a complex lipo-protein mixture which covers the alveolar fluid layer, accomplishes the physiologically essential reduction of alveolar surface tension and hereby only then renders respiratory mechanics possible. However, abundance of amphiphilic surfactant proteins (SPs) A, B, C, and D is essential for surfactant functionality [ , ].
Surfactant deficiency, as exemplarily present in prematurely newborn infants, causes the commonly fatal hyaline membrane syndrome [ , ]. Thereby, lack of surfactant results in insuperable intra-alveolar surface tension, which leads to a detrimental cascade that eventually culminates in alveolar collapse and finally, death by pulmonary failure [ ].
SP deficiency can successfully be treated by intra-tracheal administration of SP-containing preparations, which drastically reduce the mortality [ , ].
Nowadays, SPs are being increasingly recognized as important, multifunctional molecular players of extra-pulmonary physiology, exemplarily in the central nervous system (CNS) [ , ]. More specifically, antibody-equivalent, collectin-types SP-A and SP-D are involved in CNS innate immunity and clearance of cellular waste and CSF homeostasis [ , , , , , ]. Their much smaller, more hydrophobic companions SP-B and SP-C were reported to be primarily involved in the regulation of CSF rheology. SP-C—among the most surface active proteins known—exhibits significant alterations in conditions with a disturbed CSF flow, while SP-B remains at roughly the same concentration in diseases related to impaired CSF circulation [ ]. However, SP-C is not associated with the CSF bulk flow in cranial magnetic resonance imaging [ ]. Considering previous reports on SP expression pattern in the CNS and the distinct regulation of each SP in different conditions related to altered CSF flow, these findings allude to SPs’ importance for microcirculatory CSF dynamics along the perivascular route [ , , ].
So far, the relationship of rheologically active SPs in the CSF and periventricular white matter changes caused by impaired CSF microcirculation [ ] in hydrocephalus patients has not yet been investigated. Therefore, our study is aimed at (a) quantitatively determining periventricular white matter changes in hydrocephalus patients using a histogram-based approach on fluid-sensitive magnetic resonance images, (b) quantifying rheologically important SPs in corresponding CSF samples, and (c) determining the extent of their connection using correlative statistics.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Approval
This retrospective study was approved by an institutional review board (Ethikkommission Universität Leipzig Az 330-13-18 112 013).
Patients
In total, 47 patients (24 females and 23 males) were included in our analysis. Informed consent for the scientific use of CSF samples, clinical, and radiological data was given in writing from all patients or caregivers. As a first step, the patients and CSF samples were checked for CNS infections and other inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. In such cases, the patients were excluded from the study. Furthermore, none of the cases exhibited significant leakage of serum proteins into the CSF. Twenty-seven patients without any proof of a neurological pathology served as the control group. These 27 CSF specimens were obtained within the standardized diagnostic algorithm of our center including lumbar puncture for exclusion of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, or demyelinating disease. A total of 20 CSF samples of patients with clinically and neuroradiologically proven communicating hydrocephalus were included. Depending on the pathophysiology, they were classified as follows: aqueductal stenosis (AQS), acute hydrocephalus (AH) without AQS, and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Five patients with narrowed mesencephalic aqueduct and consecutively dilated lateral and third ventricles were categorized as AQS [ , ]. The group of AH consisted of six patients with acute hydrocephalus as a consequence of previously suffered SAH or purulent meningitis. All patients with AH showed signs of elevated intracranial pressure [ ]. The majority of patients (9) was categorized under the NPH group and met the following neuroimaging (ventriculomegaly and narrow convexity of the sulcus in combination with dilated Sylvian fissures) and clinical criteria (dementia, incontinence, gait ataxia).

Determination of Surfactant Protein Concentrations in CSF
SP concentrations were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Commercially available ELISA kits (USCN, Wuhan, China) were used for quantification of SP-A (E90890Hu, ELISA kit for surfactant-associated protein A), SP-C (E91623Hu, ELISA kit for surfactant-associated protein C), and SP-D (E91039Hu, ELISA kit for surfactant-associated protein D) in the CSF samples. The analysis was performed using a microplate spectrophotometer (ELISA-reader) at a wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 405 nm for absorbance measuring. Surfactant protein concentrations in nanograms per milliliter of CSF were calculated by comparison between standard series and the determined values of concentration according to the manufacturer’s manual.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all patients using a 3-T device (Trio Tim, Siemens, /Germany). The imaging protocols differed between the investigated individuals depending on the initially suspected diagnosis. All imaging protocols necessarily included a fluid-sensitive sequence which is regularly used to assess changes of interstitial fluid (ISF) homeostasis—the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (TIRM) sequence. This MRI technique is suitable for the quantification of white matter hyperintensities and reflects the extent of interstitial water content, secondary to impaired CSF flow [ , , ].
Histogram Analysis of MR Imaging
As white matter hyperintensities have been studied using a variety of non-sufficiently comparable, rather subjective visual scoring systems, we used the volumetric histogram analysis technique which has been validated in numerous previous studies with structural correlations [ , , , ].
For this purpose, MR images were transferred in a DICOM format and processed offline with a custom-made MATLAB-programmed tool (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) on a Windows-operated console. This tool displays MR images within a graphical user interface (GUI) and allows the analyst to scroll through the images. Regions of interest (ROIs) can then be drawn along the subject of interest which in our case was the periventricular white matter surrounding the lateral ventricles. The volumes of interest (VOI) was created by manually drawing ROIs along the lateral ventricles in every slice that showed a portion of the ventricles and adjacent periventricular white matter. The tool included the periventricular area of every slice with a diameter of 1 cm in every case. Every ROI was automatically modified in the GUI and saved (in a MATLAB-specific format) for later processing. All measures were performed by one author (UQ). After setting the VOIs, the following parameters were calculated and given in a spreadsheet format: first-order characteristics are mean (SImean), minimum (SImin), maximum (SImax), median (SImedian), mode (SImode), standard deviation (SIstd), and the percentiles: 10th (SIp10), 25th (SIp25), 75th (SIp75), and 90th (SIp90) of SI values. Furthermore, histogram-based characteristics of the ROI (second-order)—kurtosis, skewness, and entropy—were estimated. All calculations were performed using in-build MATLAB functions. Figure 1 provides four exemplary cases of hydrocephalus (MRI sections and the corresponding SI histograms) with increasing deep white matter signal changes due to increased fluid content. Fig. 1 Four exemplary hydrocephalus patients a – d exhibiting different extents of deep white matter fluid accumulation and the corresponding histograms
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 24™ (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). At first, collected data was evaluated by means of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range, or frequencies). Additionally, comparison of CSF-SP concentrations and quantitatively estimated white matter abnormalities between hydrocephalus patients and controls were performed by means of ANOVA. P values < 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance in all instances. Normal distribution of data was evaluated and proven by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was then performed to analyze the associations between CSF-SP concentrations and quantitative estimations of white matter hyperintensities.

Tables 5 and 6 compare results of histogram analysis reflecting white matter signal intensity levels and corresponding CSF-SP concentrations in the control group and hydrocephalus patients. In brief, all first- and second-order parameters except for the minimum of signal intensity and kurtosis of the signal intensity distribution showed statistically significant differences between healthy subjects and hydrocephalus patients. Furthermore, SP-A and SP-C concentrations exhibited statistically significant differences between both groups, while SP-D did not display significantly different CSF-SP profiles.

Correlation of White Matter Signal Alterations and SP Concentrations in the CSF
Finally, CSF-SP concentrations and signal intensity characteristics of periventricular white matter were correlated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, as Gaussian distribution was indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test.
In the overall collective, no significant correlations between white matter characteristics and SP concentrations in CSF were found.
However, after analyzing the hydrocephalus patients as subgroup and further dividing them into an acute versus chronic stage hydrocephalus [ ], the following results were observed.
In the acute hydrocephalic subgroup, correlations were as follows: SP-A showed a statistically significant correlation with SImax ( r = 0.670, p = 0.024), SIstd ( r = 0.697, p = 0.017), SIp90 ( r = 0.621, p = 0.041), and inverse correlation with entropy ( r = − 0.700, p = 0.016). SP-C correlated inversely with entropy ( r = − 0.686, p = 0.020).
For the chronic hydrocephalus subgroup, the following correlations were identified: SP-A correlated with kurtosis of the TIRM histogram ( r = − 0.746, p = 0.021). SP-C correlated with SImean ( r = − 0.688, p = 0.041), SImax ( r = − 0.741, p = 0.022), SImedian ( r = − 0.716, p = 0.030), SImode ( r = − 0.765, p = 0.016), SIstd ( r = − 0.671, p = 0.048), SIp25 ( r = − 0.740, p = 0.023), SIp75 ( r = − 0.672, p = 0.048) and SIp90 ( r = − 0.667, p = 0.050). Figure 3 exemplarily demonstrates correlations between CSF-SPs and findings of white matter signal analysis.

Discussion
This is the first study investigating the relationships between periventricular white matter signal intensities in fluid-sensitive MRI and corresponding CSF-SP profiles in the context of altered CSF circulation.
In accordance with earlier works, our current study confirmed that the amount of rheologically important SP-A and SP-C in samples of CSF from hydrocephalic patients differs considerably from those of healthy subjects [ , , , ].
As novel finding, corresponding periventricular white matter signal intensities—indicating different degrees of interstitial water content—also revealed differences of statistical significance when comparing healthy controls with hydrocephalus patients. More specifically, first-order and second-order characteristics of the periventricular white matter varied statistically significant between both groups, substantiating increased levels of ISF in the hydrocephalus group.
These findings are in line with recently published studies, which provided evidence for reduced periventricular clearance of ISF accompanied by ventricular reflux and transependymal congestion of CSF towards the deep white matter in hydrocephalus patients [ , ].
This pathological decrease of ISF clearance along the glymphatic pathway is presumably of multifactorial nature with a structural- or functional aquaporin-4 deficiency in astrocytic perivascular end feet being one of its most essential pathomechanisms [ ].
However, considering the remarkable glymphatic-like presence of SPs within the brain’s perivascular spaces [ ], their distinctly altered CSF pattern in conditions caused or accompanied by disturbed CSF homeostasis [ , , ] and their correlation with apparent CSF flow phenomena in MRI [ ], the cerebral SPs certainly contribute significantly in the regulation of glymphatic outflow and brain waste clearance. This hypothesis is substantiated by their well-studied similar functions in other organs, for example at the air-tissue interface [ , ]. Here, SPs serve two distinct purposes—host defense in the form of pathogen recognition receptor proteins and regulation of respiratory-wise essential physicochemical conditions via alteration of fluidity and surface tension of the alveolar fluid [ , ].
More specifically, SP-A is probably of equal importance for CSF physiology as it enables proper respiratory function. Firstly, it maintains rheological properties of both fluids by scavenging pathologically leaked plasma proteins, which is a common feature of critical conditions in the respiratory tract and the CNS [ , , ]. Secondly, it enhances the reduction of surface tension in both fluids directly and binds potentially harmful, local metabolic products in order to dispose of them, thereby essentially participating in the waste clearance of the lungs and brain. This is especially corroborated by earlier works that demonstrated the compensatory regulation of CSF-SP-A in conditions with altered CSF flow dynamics and the remarkable correlation of SP-A with CSF bulk flow in MRI [ ]. Thirdly, it alleviates detrimental immune responses and acts as preformed antibody-equivalent, protecting vulnerable and exposed organ systems [ , ]. The results of the present study indicate SP-A’s participation predominantly in acute hydrocephalic states, as SP-A levels correlated significantly with signal intensities of periventricular white matter in this specific subgroup. Moreover, the kurtosis of distribution of white matter intensities in chronic hydrocephalus patients also correlated significantly with SP-A levels, suggesting SP-A’s subsequent participation in the structural re-organization of the periventricular drainage in chronic hydrocephalus.
Interestingly, SP-C did not reveal any association with bulk flow in MRI of healthy subjects or patients suffering from conditions with disturbed CSF homeostasis [ ]. However, our current study identified remarkable correlations between SP-C levels and periventricular white matter signal intensities in chronic hydrocephalus patients as well as an inverse correlation with the entropy of signal intensities in acute hydrocephalic conditions. These findings strongly suggest a specific SP-C contribution to microcirculatory CSF and ISF flow along the perivascular spaces within the deep white matter. In this context, it is of great importance to also reconsider another, well-reported aspect of SP-C functionality: SP-C is not only one of the most surface active proteins known; it also contains the so-called BRICHOS domain. This domain has been demonstrated to counteract protein misfolding in various organs [ ]. Conversely, mutations affecting the BRICHOS domain have been postulated to be responsible for amyloid-related conditions like interstitial lung diseases and type 2 diabetes [ , , ]. In the light of these reports and our current results, SP-C may be essential for the clearing of brain waste not only by regulating the rheological properties of CSF and ISF within the perivascular channels but also by preventing deposition of misfolded CNS proteins.
Notably, our study suffers from a number of limitations. The major limitation of the study is its retrospective design, resulting in a comparatively small study collective with only morphological—not functional—MRI sequences, which were employed within our diagnostic algorithm. More specifically, inter scanner comparability is very limited and of rather semi-quantitative nature when employing inherently distinct morphologically sequences from different scanners. Therefore, future validation of our results necessitates a study collectively investigated with per se quantitative sequences, for example diffusion-weighted imaging.
Furthermore, white matter changes may also be related to small vessel ischemia to some extent. Currently, an accurate, morphology-based discrimination of causes for white matter hyperintensities, more specifically small vessel disease versus CSF congestion, is not accurately feasible.
Therefore, a prospective study investigating a greater number of patients with diffusion-weighted imaging, including perfusion-sensitive b values, should be performed as a more functional technique, better allowing for the quantitative assessment of perfusion and diffusion on a microscopic scale [ ].
Conclusions
Both SP-A and SP-C functionally contribute to CSF rheology and brain waste clearance. Thereby, SP-A is predominantly involved in acute stage hydrocephalus and CSF bulk flow, whereas SP-C’s main functions are closely associated with microcirculatory CSF flow and ISF exchange with characteristic alterations in chronic hydrocephalic conditions. However, SP-D apparently does not play a major role in this regard.
