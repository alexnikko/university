Introduction
Tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, has been recommended to be the first line immunosuppressive agent for prophylaxis of acute rejection after kidney transplantation (KT) [ ]. After years of clinical usage, tacrolimus is currently available in innovator and non-innovator immediate release, twice-daily formulations, and two different extended release, once daily formulations produced by different technologies: MR-4 formulation [ , ] and MeltDose formulation [ ]. These formulations of tacrolimus possess different pharmacokinetic profiles [ , ]. Some studies demonstrated that the MR-4 formulation provided less intra-patient variability of tacrolimus blood concentrations than the immediate release formulation [ , ] and has also been reported to increase treatment convenience and self-reported adherence among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) [ ].
Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and toxicity across different formulations are controversial. It was reported in some studies that the MR-4 formulation had a tendency to increase acute rejection at 6 months [ , , ] and at 12 months after KT [ , ], while others found that the MR-4 formulation had a tendency to decrease acute rejection at 6 months [ , , ] and 12 months after KT [ ]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the MeltDose formulation and immediate release tacrolimus formulation (IR-Tac) had a similar acute rejection rate at 1 year [ ] and 2 years after KT [ ].
It was reported by Ho et al. in a meta-analysis [ ], which included 5 RCTs of MR-4 formulation studies [ , , , , ], one MeltDose formulation RCT study [ ], and 15 observational studies published up until the year of 2011, that extended release and immediate release tacrolimus had similar biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft survival, and patient survival among KTRs at 12 months after their transplantation.
With strong immunosuppressive combination regimens, the incidence of acute rejection has become low, and the 1-year kidney allograft survival rate is higher than 90% in most institutions worldwide [ ]. Late allograft nephropathy, however, is still problematic. Tacrolimus is known to have nephrotoxic effects. Its nephrotoxicity may negatively contribute to the suboptimal long-term transplant outcome. Ho and colleagues also reported that the immediate release group had better renal function than the extended release group at 6 months after transplantation (three RCTs, n = 1597; standardized mean difference, SMD [95% confidence interval (CI)], − 0.17 [− 0.28 to − 0.061]; p = 0.002; I 2 = 0%). However, a significant effect was not observed at 12 months after KT (two RCTs, n = 890; SMD [95% CI], − 0.03 [− 0.16 to 0.01]; p = 0.62; I 2 = 0%).
Several more RCTs have been reported since 2011. With a higher number of patients and increased proportion of patients of different ethnicities, pooling the recently published RCTs may increase the power to detect differences of outcomes between tacrolimus formulations (if any) and determine whether the use of different tacrolimus formulations would have a beneficial impact on kidney allograft function.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) together with other outcomes of KTRs who received one of the tacrolimus extended release formulations (ER-Tac) compared to those who received the IR-Tac after transplantation.
Methods
Data sources and search strategy
Our systematic review was performed according to Cochrane Collaboration [ ] and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement [ ].
To identify relevant RCTs, the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched without language restrictions. A systematic literature search was performed from database inception to 20 April 2018. The following Medical Subject Heading terms were used: kidney transplantation and clinical trial. This was followed by the search terms: [kidney transplant* or renal transplant*] AND [extended-release tacrolimus or prolonged-release tacrolimus or once-daily tacrolimus or FK506E] AND [immediate release tacrolimus or twice-daily tacrolimus or tacrolimus or FK506] AND [randomized controlled trial or trial or random*]. In addition, the trial registrations were searched on the following websites: ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), EU Clinical Trials Register ( www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu ), Clinical Trial Results ( www.clinicaltrialresults.org ), and ISRCTN ( http://www.isrctn.com ). A historical search of relevant articles was undertaken and the correspondent of the article was contacted, if necessary.
Eligibility criteria
The studies were included in the meta-analysis if they (a) were RCTs that compared clinical outcomes between ER-Tac versus IR-Tac in KTRs and/or (b) reported one or more of the following measures: eGFR, creatinine clearance (CrCl), serum creatinine (Scr), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft survival, and patient survival. Studies conducted with pediatric populations and those reported in abstract only, editorials, conference proceedings, and letters were excluded.
Study selection
Two reviewers (W.S. and S.V.) independently screened all identified studies in our literature search for eligibility. If either reviewer identified a citation as potentially relevant, we obtained the full text of the article. The reviewers independently determined the eligibility of all studies that underwent full-text evaluation. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between the reviewers or adjudication with a third party (W.C.), if necessary.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was the eGFR at 12 months after transplantation, calculated from serum creatinine with the use of the MDRD equation [ ] or another method if the eGFR estimated by the MDRD equation was not available. The secondary outcomes were of eGFR at 6 months and after 12 months post-KT, CrCl calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation [ ] or measured by a 24-h urine collection at 6 and 12 months and after 12 months post-KT, Scr reported in mg/dL (for Scr values reported in μmol/L, they were converted to mg/dL before pooling the results), BPAR, graft survival, and patient survival within 6 months, at 12 months, and after 12 months post-KT. Data reported in a graphic format were used only when the numerical data of the interested outcome were not reported in the included trials.
Data extraction
Per the usual standardized forms, two investigators (W.S. and S.V.) independently extracted the following data from each included study: demographic information, study design, eligibility criteria, and treatment outcomes. When duplicate reports of the same trial or population were identified, the latest complete publication was selected. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion.
Assessment of risk of bias
The quality of each trial was independently assessed by two investigators (W.S. and S.V.) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool [ ]. Seven domains of assessment included random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data , selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Each included RCT was categorized as low risk, high risk, or unclear risk of bias. If a consensus could not be reached, any discrepancy was resolved by a third party (W.C.).
Statistical analysis
Assessment of heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneity between trials was determined by Cochrane’s Q test. When the Q-statistic was significant at a level of 0.1, a random effects model was used to estimate the effect size for each outcome measure. Otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. The degree of heterogeneity was quantified using I 2 statistic. The I 2 index is the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity which can be quantified as low (< 25%), moderate (25–75%), and high (> 75%) [ ].
Statistical pooling
The treatment effects from multiple studies that reported the same outcomes were pooled to integrate the findings and provide combined estimates. For continuous data, the mean difference (MD) was calculated to estimate the amount by which ER-Tac changes the outcome on average compared with IR-Tac. The pooled estimates of discrete data were expressed as relative risk (RR) to compare the probability of an outcome occurring in KTRs who received ER-Tac as compared to those who received IR-Tac. The results were depicted by forest plots with a 95% CI. The inverse variance-weighted method was used for the pooling of mean difference and relative risk.
To evaluate publication bias, a funnel plot was constructed by plotting the mean difference of the primary outcome against the standard error of the mean difference. Egger’s test was used for detecting asymmetry in a funnel plot [ ]. Preplanned sensitivity analyses of primary outcome were also performed to investigate whether or not the difference formulations of ER-Tac affect the eGFR at 12 months after KT.
All analyses were performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) program, version 5.3 Copenhagen (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Unless otherwise stated, a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Result
Literature search results
The initial electronic database search captured 1145 articles. Three additional articles were identified from the trial registration. After the exclusion of 458 duplicates, 690 titles and abstracts were screened. Then, 616 reports were further excluded, leaving 74 studies for eligibility evaluation. The majority of exclusions were made due to the articles being abstract-only publication, as described in Fig. 1 . A total of 11 RCTs, with a total number of 2678 adult KTRs, were included in this meta-analysis [ , , , , , , , , , , ]. Fig. 1 Study selection process
Study characteristics
The characteristics of the 11 included trials are summarized in Table 1 . Among these RCTs reporting the clinical outcomes of ER-Tac in comparison with IR-Tac, nine studies were MR-4 formulation RCTs [ , , , , , , , , ], and two were MeltDose formulation RCTs [ , ]. All of these included trials using tacrolimus in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids (CS). The reported outcomes are presented in Table 2 .

Risk of bias
The best performance was observed in two RCTs by Budde et al. [ ] and Rostaing et al. [ ], in which a low risk of bias was found in all of the seven domains of quality assessment, as shown in electronic supplementary material (ESM) 1 and 2 . Most of the included trials were not blinded to participants and personnel. Six of 11 trials did not provide information regarding random sequence generation and/or allocation concealment.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
eGFR at 12 months
Of the four RCTs ( n = 1738) that compared the mean eGFR between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups of KTRs at 12 months post-KT [ , , , ], the reported means of eGFR ranged from 51.7 to 60.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Based on the pooled results of these RCTs, there was no significant difference in eGFR between ER-Tac and IR-Tac at 12 months post-KT (MD, − 0.77 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [95% CI: − 2.41 to 0.87]; p = 0.36). The results among these trials were homogenous (Q statistic, p = 0.92; I 2 = 0%) as presented in Fig. 2 . According to Egger’s test, no evidence of publication bias was detected ( p = 0.756). When the MeltDose formulation study [ ] was excluded in sensitivity analysis, no substantive change to the difference was observed (three trials, n = 1195; MD, − 0.49 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 95% CI: − 2.41 to 1.42; p = 0.61; I 2 = 0%), as shown in ESM 3 . Fig. 2 Meta-analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate at 12 months post-kidney transplantation
Secondary outcomes
eGFR at 6 and 24 months
Six trials reported eGFR at 6 months after transplantation and included 1768 KTRs with the reported means of eGFR ranging from 41.8 to 58.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [ , , , , , ]. The pooled difference in eGFR was not significant between ER-Tac and IR-Tac at 6 months post-KT (MD, − 0.42 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [95% CI: − 1.82 to 0.98]; p = 0.56), as demonstrated in Fig. 3 . In addition, there was one RCTs ( n = 543) reported eGFR in ER-Tac and IR-Tac group at 24 months after KT (60.0 ± 1.40 and 60.6 ± 1.46 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively) [ ]. Fig. 3 Meta-analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate at 6 months post-kidney transplantation
CrCl
CrCl was reported in three RCTs at 6 months [ , , ] and two RCTs at 12 months after KT [ , ]. The reported mean CrCl ranged from 55.1 to 64.1 and 57.7 to 67.1 mL/min at 6 and 12 months post-KT, respectively. No significant difference in CrCl between ER-Tac and IR-Tac was observed at 6 months (MD, − 0.90 mL/min [95% CI: − 3.27 to 1.47]; p = 0.46) and at 12 months after transplantation (MD, 0.24 mL/min [95% CI: − 2.08 to 2.55]; p = 0.84) as presented in Fig. 4 . There was only one included trial that reported CrCl at 6 weeks post-KT (60.0 ± 17.3 and 54.3 ± 19.5 mL/min in ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups, respectively) [ ]. In another RCT that reported CrCl at 4 years after transplantation, no significant difference in CrCl was observed between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups ( p = 0.393) [ ].

Scr
Scr was reported in two RCTs at 6 months [ , ] and in two RCTs at 12 months post-KT [ , ]. The reported mean SCr ranged from 1.30 to 1.46 and 1.39 to 1.48 mg/dL at 6 and 12 months, respectively. No significant pooled differences in Scr were found at 6 months (MD, 0.04 [95% CI: − 0.05 to 0.13] mg/dL; p = 0.42) and 12 months after KT (MD, − 0.01 [95% CI: − 0.07 to 0.05] mg/dL; p = 0.85), as shown in Fig. 5 . One RCT reported Scr at 2 weeks after KT of 1.70 ± 3.00 and 1.40 ± 1.00 mg/dL in ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups, respectively [ ], one RCT at 6 weeks of 1.57 ± 0.68 and 1.92 ± 1.18 mg/dL, respectively [ ], and another RCT at 24 months after KT of 1.46 ± 0.06 and 1.49 ± 0.07 mg/dL, respectively [ ]. Fig. 5 Meta-analysis of serum creatinine a at 6 months and b at 12 months post-kidney transplantation
BPAR
There were seven RCTs that compared BPAR between KTRs who received ER-Tac and IR-Tac within the first 6 months post-KT. One included trial reported the incidence of BPAR at 6 weeks [ ], another reported at 3 months [ ], and the remaining five reported at 6 months [ , , , , ]. Among these RCTs, the BPAR rate reported within 6 months after transplantation was 0–16.7%. Four trials reported the incidence of BPAR between 7.5 and 17.8% at 12 months [ , , , ]. The pooled RR from these studies for BPAR within 6 months post-KT was 1.03 (seven trials, n = 2452; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.28; p = 0.81; I 2 = 39%) and at 12 months after transplantation was 1.11 (four trials, n = 1738; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.40; p = 0.40; I 2 = 0%) as presented in Table 3 and ESM 4 . One RCT reported BPAR at 4 years of 17.2 and 18.2% in ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups, respectively [ ]. Table 3 Meta-analysis results of biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft survival, and patient survival Outcomes Number of studies Number of participants Results Heterogeneity RR [95%CI] p value p value I 2 BPAR ≤ 6 months 7 2452 1.03 [0.82 to 1.28] 0.81 0.13 39% 12 months 4 1738 1.11 [0.88 to 1.40] 0.40 0.46 0% Graft survival ≤ 6 months 7 1709 1.00 [0.98 to 1.02] 0.89 0.34 12% 12 months 4 1738 1.01 [0.99 to 1.03] 0.47 0.37 5% > 12 months 2 969 1.02 [0.98 to 1.05] 0.29 0.64 0% Patient survival ≤ 6 months 8 2252 1.00 [1.00 to 1.01] 0.31 0.79 0% 12 months 4 1738 1.00 [0.99 to 1.02] 0.63 0.37 4% > 12 months 2 969 1.01 [0.98 to 1.04] 0.68 0.98 0%
Graft survival
There were seven RCTs comparing graft survival rate within the first 6 months post-KT between ER-Tac and IR-Tac. Graft survival at 6 weeks was reported in one trial [ ], and six reported graft survival at 6 months [ , , , , , ]. The pooled RR for graft survival rate within 6 months was 1.00 (seven trials, n = 1709; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.02; p = 0.89; I 2 = 12%). Graft survival rates at 12 months were reported in four included RCTs [ , , , ]. The pooled RR for 1-year graft survival rate was 1.01 (four trials, n = 1738; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.03; p = 0.47; I 2 = 5%). Two included RCTs that reported graft survival rate after 1 year post-KT: one at 2 years [ ] and the other at 4 years [ ]. The pooled RR for graft survival rate after 12 months post-KT was 1.02 (two trials, n = 969; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.05; p = 0.29; I 2 = 0%) as shown in ESM 5 .
Patient survival
Eight RCTs compared patient survival rate within the first 6 months post-KT between KTRs who received ER-Tac and IR-Tac. Among these RCTs, one reported the patient survival rate at 6 weeks [ ], another one at 3 months [ ], and the other six trials report the patient survival rate at 6 months post-KT [ , , , , , ]. The pooled RR for patient survival rate within the first 6 months post-KT was 1.00 (eight trials, n = 2252; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.01; p = 0.31; I 2 = 0%) as reported in ESM 6 . Of the four RCTs that reported the patient survival rate at 12 months [ , , , ], the pooled RR was 1.00 (four trials, n = 1738; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.02; p = 0.63; I 2 = 4%). Two included trials reported patient survival rate after 12 months post-KT, one at 2 years [ ], and the other at 4 years [ ]. Again, no significant difference in the patient survival rate was observed after 12 months between the two groups (two trials, n = 969; RR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.04; p = 0.68; I 2 = 0%).
Discussion
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the ER-Tac and IR-Tac based on eGFR in KTRs at 12 months after transplantation. The effects on eGFR together with other clinical outcomes at different times over 24 months after transplantation were also evaluated. A comprehensive search was performed to identify all eligible studies. Based on a thorough, systemic, and recent review of literature, 11 RCTs with a total number of 2678 KTRs were included. The pooled results of included RCTs showed no significant difference of eGFR at 12 months between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups (four trials, n = 1738; MD − 0.77 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 95% CI: − 2.41 to 0.87; p = 0.56) with no heterogeneity ( I 2 = 0%) and no evidence of publication bias (Egger’s test, p = 0.756). Comparing between the two tacrolimus formulations, the means of eGFR also appeared to be comparable at 6 and 24 months after KT. Consistently, CrCl and Scr were similar at different times over 4 years after transplantation. Based upon the current available evidence, ER-Tac appears to have a comparable impact on the renal function in KTRs when compared with IR-Tac formulation. In addition, there were no significant differences between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups with respect to incidence of BPAR, graft survival, and patient survival at different times over 4 years after transplantation.
To determine the difference of the renal function effect between the two tacrolimus formulations, various renal function parameters, including eGFR, Scr, and CrCl, were evaluated in this current study. GFR is generally considered the best index of kidney allograft function and also a predictor of graft and patient survival. The eGFR at 12 months after KT was selected to be the main outcome of interest in this meta-analysis. Although the measurement of GFR provides the most accurate measure of allograft function in KTRs, the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline on the monitoring, management, and treatment of kidney transplant recipients suggest estimating GFR whenever serum creatinine is measured, using one of the eGFR formulas validated for adults [ ], and eGFR by equations using Scr was used in routine clinical practice and reported in almost all of the included RCTs.
Kidney graft function at 1-year post-KT has previously been considered to be a potential surrogate which demonstrated a strong, inverse relationship between 1-year Scr and 5-year death-censored graft survival [ , ]. Of note, the Scr level at 1-year post-KT of higher than 1.5 mg/dL was commonly associated with delayed graft function and marginal donors [ ]. Our finding is consistent with the previous meta-analysis, which reported similar renal function between KTRs who received IR-Tac and those that received ER-Tac at 12 months post-KT (two trials, n = 890; SMD − 0.03, 95% CI: − 0.16 to 0.10) [ ]. In the same previous study, however, better renal function was reported in KTRs who received IR-Tac in comparison with those who received ER-Tac at 6 months post-KT (three trials, n = 1597; SMD − 0.17, 95% CI: − 0.28 to − 0.061). The difference was not apparent when more patients from recently published RCTs were considered in our current study.
Of 10 included RCTs which reported the incidence of BPAR, all but one [ ] were performed in low to moderate risk recipients of kidney transplants. All included RCTs used potent immunosuppressive regimen composed of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. These trials indicated the use of a standard dosage of tacrolimus with the target ranges of tacrolimus trough concentrations between 5 and 16 ng/mL during the first-month post-KT and 4–15 ng/mL thereafter. Not surprisingly, the incidence of BPAR is relatively low, ranging from 7.5 to 17.8% during the first year after transplantation [ , , , ].
In our current study, no significant differences in patient survival and graft survival were found between two tacrolimus formulations within 6 months, 12 months, and after 12 months post-KT. Notably, the high patient- and graft-survival rates were reported in all of the included RCTs, of which the 1-year graft survival rates were higher than 90%. Five trials have found graft survival rate greater than 95% [ , , , , ]. Of the studies that reported a graft survival rate after a year post-KT, the graft survival rates in those who received ER and IR formulation were 95.8 vs. 94.4% at 2 years [ ] and 88.1 vs. 85.4% at 4 years post-KT [ ], respectively.
In contrast with our finding, the previous meta-analysis by Ho et al. found that at 6 months after transplantation, there was a significant improvement in the overall patient survival in KTRs who received the IR-Tac compared with those who received the ER-Tac (two trials, n = 703; RR 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.06). However, a significant difference was not observed at 12 months after KT (three trials, n = 1126; RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97–1.02) [ ]. Again, the difference was not apparent when more patients from recently published RCTs were considered in our current study. All included RCTs also reported a high 1-year survival rate of more than 95%. Some studies presented the 1-year survival rate of 100% at 6 months [ , ] and 12 months [ ]. For those studies which followed the patients for longer than 1 year after kidney transplantation, the patient survival rates of 95.9 vs. 95.3% at 2 years [ ] and 93.8 vs. 93.2% at 4 years post-KT [ ] were reported in KTRs who received ER-Tac and IR-Tac regimens, respectively. With low incidence of acute kidney allograft rejection and high 1-year graft- and patient-survival rates, the window of opportunity to improve these outcomes seems to be very small, especially among KTRs with low to moderate immunologic risk.
Several studies have reported higher dosage requirements of ER-Tac among heterozygous or homozygous carriers of a CYP3A5 *1 allele (CYP3A5 expressers) compared with homozygous carriers of a CYP3A5 *3 allele (CYP3A5 non-expressers) [ , , , ]. When the IR-Tac was converted to the once-daily ER-Tac formulation, more reduction in tacrolimus exposure was reported in CYP3A5 expressers in the early and stable states after kidney transplantation [ , , ]. It is also known that the allelic frequency of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5*3 single nucleotide polymorphism, a well-known genetic factor influencing pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, differs among individuals of different ethnicities. Approximately 5–15% of Caucasians are expected to express functional CYP3A5 enzyme, whereas approximately 30% of Asians and 70% of individuals of African descent are CYP3A5 expressers [ , , ]. Inclusion of KTRs with different ethnicities, which increase the number of patients who are CYP3A5 expressers, in this current meta-analysis may improve the ability of generalization to different groups of populations.
The consistent and homogenous results were observed in all of the renal function outcomes studied in this meta-analysis. Low heterogeneity was found for graft survival within the first year after KT and 12-month patient survival rate. Only I 2 of BPAR reported within 6 months post-KT was higher than 25% (39%), indicating a moderate variance of the observed BPAR rate among various included studies.
Our study shares limitations inherent with meta-analysis in general and with studies of KT outcomes specifically. First, a few studies with small sample sizes were included in this meta-analysis. Second, reporting bias cannot be ruled out, although trials registered in different databases were also searched and publications in both English and other languages were considered. Third, publication bias may also exist leading to an under- or over-estimation of outcomes. Fourth, even though all of our studied outcomes are objective parameters, performance bias and selection bias may have occurred since some studies were not blinded or did not provide information regarding random sequence generation and/or allocation concealment. Fifth, although eGFR by equations using Scr is widely used in routine clinical practice, there have been some concerns about the inability of the Scr-based eGFR equations to accurately identify changes in GFR, in kidney transplant recipients and many transplant injuries occur without change in SCr level or eGFR. Finally, our conclusions are based on reported RCTs. Our meta-analysis suggested no significantly different influences of the two tacrolimus formulations on renal function, BPAR, graft- and patient-survival among relatively low immunologic risk KTRs. The numbers of RCTs which reported long-term outcomes and those studied in high-risk KTRs were small. Whether the different formulations of tacrolimus would impact these outcomes in a long-term follow-up and in those with a higher risk of acute allograft rejection remains to be further explored. Well-designed pharmacoeconomic analyses are also needed to compare the relative cost effectiveness of extended release versus immediate release tacrolimus.
