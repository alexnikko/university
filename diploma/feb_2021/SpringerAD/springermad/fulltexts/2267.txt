Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which leads to impairments of dopaminergic (DAergic) pathways in the basal ganglia (Gelb et al. ). As a result, PD patients present motor dysfunctions, such as bradykinesia, resting tremor and muscle rigidity, difficulties to writhe, walk and speak, slowness in initiating and executing movements, stooped posture and postural instability (Fahn ).
Toxin-based animal models for PD have long been explored in order to study the complex aspects of the disease. Among the employed neurotoxins, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is considered the best model for studying PD due to its specificity toward DAergic neurons from the SNpc (Sian et al. ), provoking PD-like motor and cognitive impairments (Moriguchi et al. ; Perry et al. ; Reksidler et al. ; Tanila et al. ).
In 1982, MPTP was accidently discovered by Langston et al. . It is a highly lipophilic compound, promptly crossing the blood–brain barrier after systemic administration. Once in the brain, MPTP is oxidized in a reaction catalyzed by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which generates its active form, the ion 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-pyridium (MPP + ). This reaction occurs mainly in astrocytes and serotoninergic neurons, being essential to the development of MPTP’s neurodegenerative effects (Chiba et al. ; Gainetdinov et al. ; Javitch and Snyder ). In turn, MPP + is selectively uptaken by DAergic neurons—through the DA transporter (DAT)—where it decreases ATP levels and increases oxidative stress by inhibiting the mitochondrial complex I, culminating in DAergic neuronal death (Schmidt and Ferger ; Smeyne and Jackson-Lewis ).
Once MPTP was considered a robust tool to induce PD in mice (Davis et al. ; Langston et al. ), a growing interest in understanding its neurotoxic mechanisms has emerged. As a result, several MPTP analogues were synthesized and tested both in vitro and in vivo, in order to elucidate structure–activity relationships, as well as to describe the molecular properties that would predictably underline their neurotoxicity, as discussed next.
At first, these studies focused on the ability of MPTP-related compounds to be oxidized by MAOs. In fact, numerous compounds were found to be good substrates for MAO-A and/or MAO-B (Youngster et al. ). Later on, it became clear that some of these analogues have different properties when compared to MPTP. For instance, 1-methyl-4-(2′-aminophenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2′-NH 2 -MPTP) had no DAergic neurodegenerative effect, while promoting a marked depletion of serotonin, the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and norepinephrine in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (Andrews and Murphy ). On the other hand, the 1-methyl-4-(2′-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2′-CH 3 -MPTP) analogue was shown to be more potent than MPTP in promoting SN DAergic neurodegeneration (Sonsalla et al. ; Youngster et al. ). Actually, 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at a dose equivalent to 20 mg/kg of MPTP free base, administered at an acute regimen (2 injections per day with a 6 h interval, for 2 days), induced a DA nigrostriatal depletion which was greater than that induced by MPTP, and an equivalent decrease in [3H]-DA uptake in neostriatal synaptosomal preparations. These results were accompanied by a virtually complete loss of nerve cells in SNpc (Youngster et al. ).
As previously discussed, MPTP oxidation by MAOs is crucial for its neurotoxicity. Likewise, it has been subsequently reported that 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is also oxidized by MAOs in crude mitochondrial preparations of mice brain (Sonsalla et al. ). It was shown not only that 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is twofold more potent than MPTP in promoting striatal DA depletion and reducing TH + labeling in the neostriatum, but also that it is a better substrate for MAOs than MPTP, although its pyridinium metabolite, 2′-CH 3 -MPP + , has equivalent affinity for DAT when compared to MPP + . Therefore, the authors have argued that the increased 2′-CH 3 -MPTP potency relies mainly on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between MPTP and 2′-CH 3 -MPTP when it comes to MAO-catalyzed metabolism (Sonsalla et al. ).
Altogether, these findings put 2′-CH 3 -MPTP forward as a valuable tool to induce PD-like alterations in rodents. However, literature on this MPTP analogue is still scarce, and no study on behavioral and molecular alterations related to 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration has been carried out so far. Therefore, our main goal in the present study—apart from histological (TH staining) and biochemical analyses (DA, DOPAC and HVA striatal tone)—was to evaluate behavioral alterations in response to three doses of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg) administered at a subchronic regimen, similar to the one our group has previously employed for MPTP administration (Hilario et al. ; Moraes et al. ). Moreover, we have also analyzed alterations in the expression of genes related to DAergic neurotransmission such as DAT, TH, MAO-A and MAO-B.
Materials and Methods
Animals
A total of 45 male C57BL/6 mice (12–14 weeks old) were used to conduct the experiments. Ethical principles of the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation (COBEA, www.cobea.org.br )—which are in accordance with international standards for research involving animals—were respected. Experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA) of the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES; protocol number 011/2011).
Animals were housed at the vivarium of the Laboratory of Molecular and Behavioral Neurobiology (LNMC) of UFES. Up to six animals were kept in polypropylene boxes (38 cm × 20 cm × 13 cm), with floor covered with sawdust in a temperature-controlled environment (22 ± 2 °C), under artificial light/dark cycle of 12 h, with food and water ad libitum.
Experimental Design
Animals were weaned at 21 days (Day 1) and divided into four groups, each of which receiving either saline or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at three doses (2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/kg). Drug administration was performed once a day for five consecutive days (Days 69–73). Forty-eight hours after the last injection the animals were submitted to behavioral tests in order to assess motor function (Day 76). On the following day (Day 77), animals were either perfused for further immunohistochemical analyses or decapitated, when the striatum and the midbrain (which included VTA and SN) were dissected and stored at – 80 °C until further molecular and biochemical analyses. All the procedures mentioned above are described in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Experimental design: 45 male C57/BL6 mice were weaned with 21 days and divided into four groups according to treatment: saline (16), or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at 2.5 ( n = 8), 5.0 ( n = 9) or 10 mg/kg ( n = 12). When animals were 90-day-old, either saline or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP was administered intraperitoneally once a day, for 5 consecutive days (Days 69–73). Animals were allowed to rest for 48 h prior to motor function assessment, which took place at day 76. Animals were tested for novelty-induced locomotor activity in the open field and grip strength as described in the Materials and Methods section. On the following day, animals were either decapitated for tissue collection and further qPCR or HPLC analyses, or perfused for subsequent immunohistochemistry analysis
Drug Administration
2′-CH 3 -MPTP was administered as previously described (Hilario et al. ; Moraes et al. ). Briefly, at days 69–73, animals received either saline or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP (M103, Sigma-Aldrich ® , St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in saline at 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), for five consecutive days. After the drug administration period, animals were allowed to rest for 48 h, in order to consolidate the neuronal damage prior to motor function assessment.
Motor Function Tests
Motor function tests were performed 48 h after the last drug administration as previously described (Hilario et al. ; Moraes et al. ). All animals were submitted to motor function tests, being divided into the following four groups: control/saline ( n = 16), 2.5 mg/kg 2′-CH 3 -MPTP ( n = 8), 5.0 mg/kg 2′-CH 3 -MPTP ( n = 9) and 10 mg/kg 2′-CH 3 -MPTP ( n = 12).
Locomotor Activity in the Open Field
Locomotor activity in the open field was performed in an EP 149 activity-monitoring box (Insight ® , Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil). After overnight habituation to the experimentation room, animals were introduced into the box and allowed to freely explore the environment for 5 min. All locomotor activity was monitored, and the obtained results were expressed in total distance travelled in cm.
Grip Strength
After locomotor activity assessment, animals were allowed to rest and get habituated to the experimental room for 1 h prior to grip strength measurements. Forelimb strength was evaluated as previously described (Hilario et al. ). An in-house built gauge apparatus was used to measure strength in grams of force (gF). WinDaQ (DATAQ ® Instruments, Akron, OH, USA) was used for data recording. After the habituation period, animals were allowed to grasp a triangular bar, after which the mice’s body was quickly pulled away. Each animal was subjected to five trials during a maximum period of 50 s. Mean ± SEM of the five measurements was calculated, and data were expressed as percentage of the control (saline group).
Dopamine, DOPAC and HVA Measurement by HPLC
The tone of dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum was determined using an HPLC system (Shimadzu Corp, Kyoto, Japan) with an electrochemical detector (VT-03, Decode II, Antec, Fremont, CA, USA) as previously described (Areal et al. ; Hilario et al. ), with modifications. Each frozen tissue sample was sonicated in 250 µL of 0.1 M perchloric acid for 30 s. After 10-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged (15,000× g , 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered and injected into the HPLC system equipped with a reverse-phase column (Eclipse XBD-C18 Agilent, 4.6 × 250 mm, 50 µL). The column temperature was maintained at 27 °C, and the detector potential was set at +530 mV. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 100 mg/L octanesulfonic acid, pH 4.75; the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min. Catecholamine dosage was normalized by total protein content, as determined by the Bradford method (Bradford ), and expressed as the percentage of control (saline group).
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses, animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (90/10 mg/kg) and perfused with PBS 1X (5 min) and formalin 4% (10 min). After perfusion, the brain was dissected and placed in formalin 4% for 24 h, at 4 °C. Then, it was transferred to sucrose 30% in formalin 4% up to 48 h, at 4 °C. Finally, brains were placed in ethanol 70%, dehydrated in graded ethanol baths (70, 95 and 100%) and xylene, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3–5 µm thickness.
The formalin-fixed sections were mounted on slides and deparaffinized in xylene and graded ethanol solutions (100, 95, 70, 50%). After peroxidase blocking (0.3% H 2 O 2 in methanol, 30 min, room temperature) and antigenic blocking (5% CFS in 0.3% Triton X–100/PBS, 30 min, room temperature), slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (T1299, Sigma-Aldrich; 1:10,000) overnight, at 4 °C, in an humidified chamber. Vectastain ® ABC kit mouse IgG (PK-6102; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used to detect the primary antibody, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DAB peroxidase substrate kit (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories) was used as the chromogen, and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin QS (H-3404, Vector Laboratories).
A total of 15 animals were used for IHC analysis, being 5 animals from the control group, 3 from the 2.5 mg/kg group, 3 from the 5.0 mg/kg group and 4 from the 10 mg/kg group.
Image acquisition was performed using a Leica 2500 microscope, and TH staining quantification was performed using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Gene Expression Analyses
As previously described, the midbrain was dissected, immediately frozen in dry ice and stored at − 80 °C. Total RNA was extracted with TRI ® Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), treated with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and used for cDNA synthesis using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). CFX96 real-time PCR (Bio-Rad) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) were used for qPCR. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed with the 2 −∆∆Ct method, using β-actin as the reference gene for normalization. Genes chosen for qPCR analyses were tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The sequences for each primer are described in Table 1 . The number of animals per group for gene expression analyses ranged between 4 and 5 animals. Relative expression data were expressed as mean ± SEM for each group normalized by the control group (saline).

Results
2′-CH3-MPTP Caused Midbrain DAergic Neuronal Death Accompanied by Striatal DA Depletion
IHC was performed to access TH staining in the SNpc region. As shown in Fig. 2 a, administration of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP resulted in reduced TH immunostaining in the SNpc region of animals from all treated groups ( F (3,1) = 47.02; p < 0.0001), indicating DAergic neuronal death. Moreover, as revealed by the quantitative analysis of the staining (Fig. 2 b), administration of 2.5 mg/kg 2′-CH 3 -MPTP resulted in about 30% depletion of TH neurons ( p < 0.05), followed by the 5.0 mg/kg dose causing about 70% depletion ( p < 0.001), and finally the 10 mg/kg dose resulting in nearly 85% depletion of TH + neurons ( p < 0.001). Fig. 2 Administration of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP causes dose-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the SNpc. Animals injected with saline ( n = 5) or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at 2.5 ( n = 3), 5.0 ( n = 3) or 10 mg/ml ( n = 4) were perfused and TH staining was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. a Representative images of TH immunodetection in VTA sections from animals after administration of saline or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP. b Quantitative analysis of TH + cells expressed by the ratio between neuron area and total area. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc. * p < 0.05; *** p < 0.001
Likewise, as revealed by HPLC (Fig. 3 ), treatment with 2′-CH 3 -MPTP caused a reduction in DA tone in the striatum when compared to the control group ( F (3,21) = 12.46; p < 0.0001). In fact, as shown in Fig. 3 a, animals receiving the drug at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg showed no DA depletion when compared to the control group. Those receiving the intermediate dose of 5.0 mg/kg had a depletion of ~ 45%, whereas those receiving the higher dose of 10 mg/kg had a depletion of ~ 90% ( p < 0.001). Therefore, a trend toward a dose-dependent reduction in DA following 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration was observed. Fig. 3 Effect of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration in striatal DA, DOPAC and HVA content and DA metabolism. Striatal tonus of dopamine ( a ), DOPAC ( b ) and HVA ( c ) in response to saline ( n = 10) or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at 2.5 ( n = 5), 5.0 ( n = 4) and 10 mg/kg ( n = 5–6) was assessed by HPLC. Also, the effect of the different doses of the neurotoxin on DA metabolism with respect to DOPAC ( d ), HVA ( e ) and DOPAC + HVA combined ( f ) was calculated. Data are expressed as the mean percentage of the control ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
Regarding DOPAC levels, an inverted U-shaped response pattern was observed upon treatment with 2′-CH 3 -MPTP (Fig. 3 b). At doses of 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, a reduction in over 90 and ~ 85% was observed, respectively ( p < 0.001 for both doses). On the other hand, the 5.0 mg/kg dose led to a reduction in only about 40% ( p < 0.05). Likewise, HVA levels followed the same pattern: at the 2.5 mg/kg dose it was reduced by ~ 80%, and at 10 mg/kg by ~ 70% ( p < 0.01 for both doses). At the 5.0 mg/kg dose, HVA levels corresponded to about 88% of the control ones. The reduction in DOPAC and HVA content following the administration of 2.5 mg/kg of the toxin prompted us to investigate whether DA metabolism was affected by the treatment, regardless of the maintenance of DA levels observed at this dose.
Indeed, as anticipated, we observed that DA turnover was affected by the treatment with 2′-CH 3 -MPTP with respect to DOPAC ( F (3,20) = 13.89, p < 0.0001), HVA ( F (3,20) = 27.42, p < 0.001) and DOPAC + HVA ( F (3,20) = 29.46, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3 d–f). When the 2.5 mg/kg dose was administered, a decrease in DA turnover was observed in relation to DOPAC ( p < 0.001), HVA ( p < 0.05) and DOPAC + HVA ( p < 0.001). DA turnover was not altered in response to the 5.0 mg/kg dose. Finally, in response to the 10 mg/kg dose, an increase in DA turnover with respect to DOPAC ( p < 0.05), HVA ( p < 0.001) and DOPAC + HVA ( p < 0.001) was also observed.
2′-CH3-MPTP Administration Results in Motor Function Alterations in Mice
Both locomotor activity ( F (3,4) = 5.145; p = 0.0041) and grip strength ( F (3,40) = 7.145; p = 0.0006) were affected by 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration. Concerning locomotor activity (Fig. 4 a), animals exposed to either 2.5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of the drug showed no alterations when compared to the control group, whereas animals exposed to 5 mg/kg presented hypolocomotion ( p < 0.01). Fig. 4 Effect of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP on motor parameter. Following the five-day administration of saline ( n = 16) or the neurotoxin at 2.5 ( n = 8), 5.0 ( n = 9) and 10 mg/kg ( n = 12), animals were allowed to rest for 48 h prior to motor tests. a The total distance travelled within 5 min was recorded for each animal and is expressed in cm. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. b Assessment of the forelimb grip strength was performed, and the average of five trial was used to calculate the mean strength for each group. Data are expressed as the mean percentage of the control ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01
On the other hand, the inverse was observed when grip strength was taken into account (Fig. 4 b): animals exposed to either 2.5 mg/kg ( p < 0.01) or 10 mg/kg ( p < 0.05) of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP exhibited decreased strength when compared to the control group, whereas the 5.0 mg/kg group showed no deficit in this parameter when compared to the saline-treated animals.
Administration of 2′-CH3-MPTP Disturbs the Gene Expression of DAergic Neurotransmission Components in the Midbrain
Gene expression of DAergic neurotransmission components, namely DAT, TH, MAO-A and MAO-B, was analyzed in the midbrain of animals exposed to 2′-CH 3 -MPTP. As shown in Fig. 5 , the expression of all analyzed genes was affected by 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration. DAT expression (Fig. 5 a; F (3,14) = 6.490; p = 0.0056) was increased when the drug was administered at the dose of 5.0 mg/kg, when compared to animals from the control group ( p < 0.05). Administration of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP did also affect TH expression (Fig. 5 b; F (3,14) = 4.245; p = 0.0249), although a singular pattern was observed in this case. Administration of 5.0 mg/kg of the toxin had no effect, but when animals were treated with 2.5 mg/kg TH mRNA expression was decreased ( p < 0.01), whereas a trend toward its increase was observed when animals received 10 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP ( p = 0.0691). MAO-A ( F (3,14) = 20.44; p < 0.001) and MAO-B ( F (3,14) = 8.725; p = 0.0016) expression showed the greater variation among groups, with the higher expression of the enzymes’ mRNA being observed in response to 5.0 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of the drug, respectively. MAO-A expression (Fig. 5 c) was increased by the administration of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of the drug when compared to the saline-treated animals ( p < 0.001 for both groups). On the other hand, MAO-B expression (Fig. 5 d) was statistically increased only in animals receiving 5 mg/kg of the toxin ( p < 0.01). Fig. 5 Effect of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP on the expression of genes involved in DA neurotransmission. Following administration of saline ( n = 5) or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at 2.5 ( n = 5), 5.0 ( n = 4) or 10 mg/kg ( n = 4) once a day, for five consecutive days, the expression of DAT ( a ), TH ( b ), MAO-A ( c ) and MAO-B ( d ) relative to β-actin was assessed. Data are expressed as the mean percentage of the control ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001
Discussion
Neurotoxin-induced parkinsonism in rodents has long been used as a model for PD (Bové and Perier ). One of these neurotoxins, 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, has been used since early 1980s when it was shown to induce nigrostriatal DA depletion more potently than its previously used analogue, MPTP. However, few reports on this drug have been made available since then. In fact, no report, as far as we know, focuses on specific PD-associated molecular and behavioral alterations in response to 2′-CH 3 -MPTP or explores the effect of different administration regimens on these parameters. Here we have applied a subchronic exposure protocol in which 2′-CH 3 -MPTP has been administered at three different doses (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. This protocol allowed us to identify behavioral and molecular alterations associated with specific 2′-CH 3 -MPTP doses, which did not necessarily follow a linear dose-dependent pattern.
Previous reports on 2′-CH 3 -MPTP described an acute scheme of administration, usually with multiple i.p or subcutaneous (s.c.) injections within a single day. As a result, many authors have described DA—and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA—depletion in the striatum. Sonsalla et al. ( ) assessed striatal DA and metabolites content 4 days after 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration (4 i.p injections at 2-h intervals). They found a depletion in DA when the 8 and 10 mg/kg doses were used, whereas no effect was observed when the drug was administered at either 2 or 4 mg/kg (Sonsalla et al. ). Likewise, when 2′-CH 3 -MPTP was administered at 20 mg/kg (2 i.p injections with a 6 h interval), 90% depletion on striatal DA, DOPAC and HVA was observed 7 days after cessation of treatment (Andrews and Murphy ). These acute protocols have shown that 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is more potent than its analogue MPTP (Abdel-Wahab ; Sonsalla et al. ).
Previous studies from our group described a similar subchronic administration regimen for MPTP, using the same protocol employed in the present study. We have shown that 25 mg/kg of MPTP leads to 60% depletion of DA and 50% depletion in both DOPAC and HVA (Hilario et al. ). When administered at the dose of 30 mg/kg, MPTP led to 80% DA and 60% DOPAC depletion with no statistically significant decrease in HVA (Moraes et al. ). Here we show that, even at the 5 mg/kg dose, 2′-CH 3 -MPTP led to a comparable striatal DA, DOPAC and HVA depletion effect when compared to MPTP administration. Moreover, DA, DOPAC and HVA striatal depletion in response to 10 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP exceeded those observed for MPTP in every dose employed. Altogether, the results obtained through the subchronic protocol adopted in the present work corroborate previous evidence attesting the higher potency of this neurotoxin when compared to MPTP, being also quite similar to those previously reported for the acute 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration.
Despite the depletion in DA and metabolites observed in response to 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, particularly at the 10 mg/kg dose, mean striatal TH immunolabeling was statistically similar among animals treated with either 5 or 10 mg/kg of the drug. Moreover, a trend toward an increase in TH transcription in the midbrain following the administration of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at the higher dose could represent a compensatory mechanism elicited by the drug. In fact, it has been recently reported that MPTP exposure results in a cooperative synthesis of DA, in which “monoenzymatic” neurons—expressing either TH or aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)—would cooperate in order to compensate DAergic nigrostriatal neuron failure (Kozina et al. ). In that study, it was shown that upon MPTP administration the number of monoenzymatic fibers, as well as TH mRNA expression, increased with the hypofunction of the DAergic system. Therefore, it is likely that a similar compensatory mechanism would be elicited by 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, providing a possible explanation for the trend observed toward the increased TH mRNA expression.
Oxidation of MPTP and 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, which is catalyzed by MAOs, is a critical aspect of the neurotoxic process evoked by both drugs (Chiba et al. ; Sonsalla et al. ). Notwithstanding, it has already been shown that 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is more potent than MPTP. Sonsalla et al. ( ) have shown that, according to pharmacokinetic parameters, 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is a better substrate for MAOs than MPTP (Sonsalla et al. ). Moreover, they have revealed that low doses of the MAO inhibitors (MAOI) deprenyl and MDL 72145—which are selective for MAO-B in these conditions—were not able to prevent 2′-CH 3 -MPTP-induced neurodegeneration, while preventing the MPTP-induced one. On the other hand, when higher doses of MDL 72145—which would be nonselective for MAO-A/B—were used, the damage resulting from either MPTP or 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration was prevented. In light of this, the authors argued that, unlike MPTP, 2′-CH 3 -MPTP relies not only in MAO-B but also on MAO-A for its oxidation.
Herein we show that, whereas the transcription of MAO-A is upregulated by 5.0 and 10 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, the upregulation of MAO-B transcription was statistically significant only in response to 5.0 mg/kg of the drug, being increased almost twofold when compared to the control group. Previous data from our group have shown that only MAO-A transcription is upregulated by MPTP (Hilario et al. ), with MAO-B expression remaining unaffected by it (A. L. Herlinger, unpublished observation ). Therefore, although it is possible that MAO-A could actually play a role in 2′-CH 2 -MPTP oxidation, it is also likely that, due to increased MAO-B expression only in response to 2′-CH 3 -MPTP but not to MPTP, higher doses of MAOI would be required in order to achieve the same inhibitory and neuroprotective effects observed in MPTP models of PD. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that neither a MAO-B inhibitor (selegeline) nor a MAO-A inhibitor (clorgyline) was able to prevent striatal DA depletion 24 h after administration (5 mg/kg per injection, 4 s.c. injections, hourly) of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP (Finnegan et al. ). However, when those MAOI were combined, striatal DA depletion was prevented. It has been reported that even at a dose selective to MAO-A, clorgyline inhibits MAO-B at 30% (Lamensdorf et al. ). Therefore, the prevention of DA depletion observed by Finnegan et al. ( ) in response to the combination of selegeline and clorgyline could in fact be due to an increased inhibition of MAO-B alone.
Regarding 2′-CH 3- MPTP-promoted DAergic neuronal death, both 5.0 and 10 mg/kg doses had similar effects, although, as expected, the striatal DA depletion in response to the higher dose was greater. The equivalent potency of 5.0 and 10 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3- MPTP in inducing neuronal cell death could be at least partially explained by the increased DAT expression in response to the lower dose. As previously discussed, the neurotoxic pyridinium ion 2′-CH 3 -MPP + , like its analogous MPP + , is uptaken by the dopaminergic neurons through DAT. As shown in the Results section, DAT expression is increased over twofold following 2′-CH 3 -MPTP administration at 5.0 mg/kg. Therefore, it is likely that DAT overexpression would allow more 2′-CH 3 -MPP + to enter the cells, increasing its neurotoxicity. And, although DAT overexpression in PD has not been reported, an increased DA reuptake rate by DAT should contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. Lee et al. ( ) have shown that the complexation of DAT with α-synuclein—a protein implicated in PD—accelerates DA reuptake and dopamine-induced apoptosis due to oxidative stress (Lee et al. ). Therefore, the overexpression of DAT in response to 5 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP could result in biochemical and cellular conditions more representative of those related to PD neurodegeneration.
Indeed, neurodegeneration of DA neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway is responsible for the motor dysfunctions associated with PD—such as hypokinesia—reflecting striatal DA depletion. However, despite striatal DA depletion, previous works employing MPTP as a parkinsonian neurotoxin described hyperlocomotion as a result of the treatment (Chia et al. ; Colotla et al. ; Hilario et al. ; Moraes et al. ). Conversely, in the present work, animals who received 2′-CH 3 -MPTP at 5 mg/kg had reduced ambulation when compared to all the other experimental groups. It has already been shown that extracellular DA concentration depends on DAT, with the rate of DA reuptake by DAT being inversely related do DA concentration (Ferris et al. ). DAT localizes at the pre-synaptic neuron; therefore, the increased DAT mRNA expression in the midbrain observed in response to 5 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP could represent an upregulation of DAT protein in the axonal terminus of SN neuronal projections into the striatum. In turn, this could indicate that, although total DA tone is higher than that of the 10 mg/kg group, the extracellular DA availability would be decreased in the 5 mg/kg animals as a consequence of the increased rate of DA reuptake in this group.
In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that DA turnover following administration of 5 mg/kg 2′-CH 3 -MPTP was unaltered, despite its level being reduced in nearly half when compared to the control group. Upon release in the synaptic cleft, DA can either be reuptaken—through DAT—and sequestered into vesicles or be taken up by glia cells, where it is degraded by MAOs and COMT (catechol-O-metiltransferase) into several catecholic compounds, such as DOPAC and HVA (reviewed by Meiser et al. ). Therefore, taken together, our data point to a scenario where, despite striatal DA and metabolites depletion in response to the 10 mg/kg dose being more pronounced, alterations in the bioavailability of DA in the synaptic cleft, due to molecular alterations happening exclusively in response to the 5.0 mg/kg dose, could induce a downregulation of DA neurotransmission that would, in turn, culminate in PD-like hypokinesia.
On the other hand, despite no striatal DA depletion having been observed in animals treated with 2.5 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, which is in accordance with the little TH + neuronal death observed in these conditions, striatal DOPAC and HVA levels were as low as those from animals treated with 10 mg/kg of the neurotoxin. This could be due to the reduced DA turnover detected in response to the administration of 2.5 mg/kg of the toxin. Although we were unable to pinpoint a molecular mechanism to explain this reduction in DA metabolism in response to the lower dose of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP employed here, it is possible that this DA turnover deficit—despite normal striatal DA levels—could be responsible for the reduced grip strength presented by these animals. It is worthy of note that previous reports—in which an acute administration protocol was applied—were unable to detect any deficits in DA, DOPAC or HVA in response to a similar dose (2.0 mg/kg) of the drug (Sonsalla et al. ). That clearly indicates that the protocol adopted (acute vs. subchronic) can affect many more aspects of the neurobiology of the animals apart from the degree of DAergic neurodegeneration, and this should be borne in mind when designing the experiment.
Interestingly, DOPAC and HVA levels followed an inverted U-shaped response pattern, with 2.5 and 10 mg/kg of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP causing the greater depletion of these metabolites levels, despite the dose-dependent-like depletion pattern observed for DA tonus. This same inverted U-shaped pattern was observed for the grip strength of the animals upon treatment. Inversely, an U-shaped pattern was observed when analyzing the ambulation of animals, with hypolocomotion being detected only in response to the intermediate dose of the drug. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanisms involved in the different phenotypes presented by the animals in this model of PD rely not only on the extent of nigrostriatal DAergic neuronal death, but also on molecular alterations which have implications for DA metabolism.
Regarding the dose–response pattern for 2′-CH 3 -MPTP, we observed that for most of the analyzed parameters—which comprise gene expression, catecholamines levels and behavior—a nonlinear dose–response effect was usually observed. These biphasic dose–response curves have been described as the defining feature of hormesis, a phenomenon in which a beneficial or stimulatory effect is observed at low doses, whereas an adverse or inhibitory effect is observed at high doses (Lushchak ). Indeed, although this type of response might seem unusual, it has already been reported that toxins more often than not exhibit a hormetic dose–response pattern rather than a linear one (Mattson and Calabrese ), which has been widely discussed in the literature (Calabrese ; Demirovic and Rattan ; Lushchak ; Rattan and Demirovic ). Therefore, instead of being unusual, the pattern described for the effects elicited by 2′-CH 3 -MPTP is actually quite common and even expected for most toxins.
Herein we provide the first description of the molecular and behavioral alterations in response to three different doses of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP. With this characterization, we were able to show that the molecular and biochemical alterations were dose specific, not following a dose-dependent pattern. In fact, as a consequence of such molecular and biochemical alterations, we had also observed that the motor functions presented by the animals varied significantly among the doses they were exposed to. Overall, this report not only brings new evidence on the distinct effects of 2′-CH 3 -MPTP when compared to its analogue MPTP, but also on the distinct effects of the administration regimen chosen. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that further molecular and behavioral assessments on 2′-CH 3 -MPTP ought to be carried out in order to promote a better understating of the mechanisms by which this neurotoxin provokes PD-like symptoms.
