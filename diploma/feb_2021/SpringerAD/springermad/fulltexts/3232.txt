INTRODUCTION
It was predicted that in 2018, about 178,560 new cases of invasive melanoma skin cancer (MSC) will be detected in the USA and about 9320 patients will die. More than 5.3 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are diagnosed each year, among which, 4.3 million cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and more than a million cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ( https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts ). Each year, NMSC leads to more than 18,000 deaths in the USA. The yearly cost of skin cancer treatment in the USA is estimated to be about $8.1 billion: $3.3 billion for melanoma and about $4.8 billion for non-melanoma skin cancers ( ).
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is the major source of almost all of the cases of NMSC ( ). The American Cancer Society (ACS), Center for Disease Control (CDC), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) have suggested to avoid sun exposure during peak hours of radiation, wear protective clothing and hats as well as use sunscreen ( , ). Although, all these recommendations filter some UV rays to some extent, they do not block all UV rays. Among the most, sunscreen use has been highly recommended in the sunlight. Oxybenzone, octylmethoxycinnamate, and homosalate are some of the most widely used organic UV filter ingredients in the preparation of sunscreen ( ). Though, these chemicals are FDA approved, laboratory studies of several sunscreen chemicals indicated that they may mimic hormones and disrupt the hormone system ( ). Inorganic chemicals like TiO 2 have provided strong sun protection with few health concerns. Moreover, they do not break down into toxic products on sunlight exposure ( , ).
Further, the photo-carcinogenic cascade is complex and involves a myriad of processes involving DNA damage, mutation, increased cell proliferation and survival with decreased apoptosis, enhanced angiogenesis, and reduced immune activity ( , ). To date, the current strategies to avoid UV exposure and use of sunscreen products provide limited protection as they simply filter UV rays and fail to target pathways to UV-induced tumorigenesis relevant to skin carcinogenesis. Thus, in addition to UV filters such as sunscreen products, there is an urgent need to identify and test promising agents for skin cancer chemoprevention, targeting UV-induced tumorigenesis.
Qu is a natural antioxidant flavonoid, has been reported to exhibit anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and chemo-preventive activities. ( ). The activities of Qu include scavenging oxygen radicals and inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and it has the highest antioxidant action of all the flavonoids ( , , ). In two pilot, open-label, clinical trials, Qu significantly decreased contact dermatitis and photosensitivity, by significantly inhibiting NF-kappa B activation and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines ( , ). Based on these early studies, topical application of a formulation that permits sufficient absorption of Qu may prevent UVB radiation–induced epidermal cell damage and inflammation. However, extremely poor solubility and permeability across epidermis have restricted in vivo and clinical evaluation of Qu for UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis prevention. Shi X et al . and Nan et al . developed Qu-loaded PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles and Qu-loaded chitosan nanoparticles respectively and evaluated against UVB-induced skin damage. However, the animal study for Qu-loaded PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles and Qu-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was limited for 48 h and 5 days respectively ( , , ). Moreover, large-scale manufacturing and commercial feasibility of PLGA nanoparticle are not possible. Therefore, there is a need of drug delivery systems which can reach up to deeper layers of the skin, can target the cancer cells, and can be transformed to commercially viable formulations with topically acceptable excipients ( , , , , , , , , ). Nanocrystals are an excellent drug delivery system since they are composed of 100% drug and do not require carrier material as in polymeric nanoparticles. They are crystalline in nature and can reach deeper into the skin layers ( , ).
Since few years, the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) and other regulatory agencies like MHRA and EMEA have been giving emphasis on quality by design (QbD) approach for improvement of the product quality by understanding product parameters and critical process based on risk management ( , , ). The design of experiment (DoE) is an important part of QbD, which helps in assessing the effect of a large number of critical process parameters (CPP) on critical quality attributes (CQA) of the product. Additionally, it minimizes the number of trials for optimization of the final product ( , , ). In the present work, we have developed Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) topical nanogel by applying QbD principles and the DoE approach. Topical nanogel quality was assessed by determining its particle size, polydispersity index (PI), and zeta potential drug assay along with its physical and chemical stability studies. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize process parameters for topical nanogel of Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%), evaluate its in vivo chemoprevention activity, and determine the underlined mechanism for the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; METHOCEL K4M Premium CR Grade) was a generous donation by the DOW Chemical Company (Midland, MI). Qu was purchased from AK Scientific, CA, USA, and TiO 2 was purchased from Spectrum, CA, USA. HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and water were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Distilled water was used throughout the study. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.
Animals
SKH-1 hairless female mice (6-week old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, for inducing the skin cancer. The animals were kept in cages with beddings and maintained under controlled conditions of 22 ± 2°C, 12:12-h light: dark cycle, and 50 ± 15% RH. The mice were provided with feeding (Harlan Teklad) and water ad libitum . They were housed at Florida A&M University in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for a week before the onset of all experiments. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Florida A& M University, FL, approved all animal protocols that were observed in this study.
DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF NANOGEL
Preliminary Screening of Qu Concentration, HPH Pressure, Organic Solvent Concentration
Formulation of Qu Nanocrystals
Briefly, Qu (quantity as mentioned below in the optimization process) was dissolved in organic solvent (THF) (quantity as mentioned below in the optimization process). Further, Qu solution was injected dropwise into water in a beaker which was kept for stirring on the magnetic stirrer. Formed Qu suspension was kept overnight with constant stirring at room temperature to evaporate THF. Further, Qu suspension was processed through high-pressure homogenization (HPH) (Nanodebee, BEE International, MA, USA) for 2 cycles to obtain Qu nanocrystals.
Optimization of Qu Concentration
Nanocrystal formulation consisting of Qu concentrations 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, and 0.20% were formulated and processed at 30,000-psi pressure (Table 1 in supplementary data). Further, all the formulations were evaluated for particle size, PI, and zeta potential.
Optimization of High-Pressure Homogenization Pressure
The main objective of optimizing the HPH pressure was to process the drug for fewer cycles to avoid the stress on the drug due to heat generated in the HPH. Nanocrystal formulations containing 0.08% of Qu and 4% of THF were formulated and processed at different HPH pressures from 2500 to 30,000 psi (Table 2 in supplementary data). Further, they were evaluated for particle size, PI, and zeta potential. The range of the HPH pressure was selected which produces nanocrystals below 600 nm.
Optimization of Organic Solvent Concentration
Nanocrystal formulations containing Qu (0.08%) were prepared using 4, 8, and 12% of THF and processed at 30,000-psi pressure. Further, all the formulations were evaluated for particle size, PI, and zeta potential. The purpose of optimizing THF concentration was to evaluate its effect on particle size, PI, and zeta potential.
Design of Experiment
Formulation was designed using the Box-Behnken design with 12 design points and 5 center points to evaluate the effects of different variables. Drug concentration range, organic solvent concentration range, and HPH pressure range was already optimized during the preliminary studies. Therefore, drug concentration (A), organic solvent concentration (B), and HPH pressure (C) were selected as independent variables for further optimization of the formulation. Optimization was based on the particle size, PI, and drug assay. Statistical calculations were carried out using Design Expert 7.1.6. (Stat-Ease, Inc., USA).
Formulation of Nanogel
After the preliminary studies and optimization of drug concentration, organic solvent concentration, and HPH pressure, four batches of nanogel were formulated. As shown in Table I , four nanogels were formulated with different composition of Qu and TiO 2 . HPMC was used as a gelling agent. Glycerin and propylene glycol were used as humectant. Briefly, to the pre-prepared Qu nanocrystal formulation, TiO 2 was added and homogenized for 10 min at 10,000 rpm by a microprocessor (cyclone I.Q. 2 , Virtis). Further, the formulation was gelled by HPMC gel (5%), glycerin (2%), and propylene glycol (3%) using a propeller (VWR international, PA, USA) at 200 rpm for 4 h. Table I Composition of optimized nanogel Batch Qu (%) TiO 2 (%) HPMC (%) Glycerin (%) Propylene glycol (%) Water (%) F1 0.08 0 5 2 3 up to 100 F2 0.12 0 5 2 3 up to 100 F3 0.12 5 5 2 3 up to 100 F4 0.12 15 5 2 3 up to 100
Physicochemical Characterization
Particle size, PI, and zeta potential of the nanocrystals were measured using a Nicomp 380 ZLS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which employs dynamic light scattering to measure the particle size distribution and particle electrophoretic mobility to determine the charges of the particles. All the samples were analyzed three times.
HPLC Analysis
The Waters HPLC alliance e2695 system with PDA detector was used for analysis of Qu at a wavelength of 370 nm. The mobile phase was ACN and phosphate buffer (pH 3) at a ratio of 40:60 ( v / v ). The mobile phase flow rate, the injection volume, and the retention time was 0.7 ml/min, 50 μl, and 7.9 min respectively. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Empower software (Waters Corporation, MA). The calibration curve (peak area vs concentration) was generated over the range of 1–50 μg/ml and was found to be linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998. To determine the drug content in Qu nanocrystal formulation, 0.5 ml of formulation was dissolved in ACN and the volume was made up to 1 ml in the Eppendorf. Further, the Eppendorf was vortexed for 10 min to dissolve the drug completely in the ACN. Then, 50 μl from this stock solution was diluted to 1 ml with the mobile phase and analyzed by the HPLC. To determine the drug content in Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogels, 50 mg of the gel was dissolved in ACN in a 50-ml volumetric flask and vortexed for 10 min to dissolve the drug completely in ACN. Furthermore, 50 μl from this stock solution was diluted to 1 ml with mobile phase and analyzed by HPLC.
Differential Scanning Calorimetric Analysis of Nanogel
The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis of Qu (0.12%) was carried out using the DSCQ100 System (TA Instrument, USA) to ascertain chemical stability of the drug since the nanocrystal formulation was processed at high pressure and temperature. ( ). Briefly, 5 mg of the drug was weighed into an aluminum pan (TA Instrument, USA) that was then sealed hermetically with a lid. For analyzing the Qu (0.12%), 5 ml of nanogel was kept in the incubator at 37°C to evaporate the water. Further, the leftover solid part of nanogel was recovered and weighed into an aluminum pan. The samples were heated at a temperature range of 30 to 310°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min under nitrogen purge. All data was analyzed using Universal software analysis 2000 (TA Instrument, USA).
Rheological study
Viscosity of the prepared gels (Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%)) was measured using AR 1500 Rheometer (New Castle, DE). Samples were measured by using parallel plate (diameter of 25 mm) geometry at 25°, 31°, 40°, and 50°C temperatures and a measuring gap of 1000 μm and the effect of temperature on viscosity was studied.
In vitro Skin deposition study
Preparation of Skin
Dermatomed human skin was procured from Platinum Training (Henderson, NV), shipped in 10% glycerin in saline solution with a thickness of about 0.5 ± 0.1 mm. The skin was stored at − 80°C and was defrosted and rinsed with distilled water for 15–20 min to eliminate excess glycerin right before all the experiments. Our laboratory has previously validated the methods of storage and preparation of dermatomed human skin and has certified that the skin retains its integrity for accurate results ( , ).
Skin Deposition Study
The skin deposition from Qu (0.08%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) nanogel, and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel was determined in comparison with Qu suspension. For this study, the dermatomed human skin was mounted between the donor and receiver compartments of Franz diffusion cells (PermeGear Inc., Riegelsville, PA, USA). The receiver compartment consists of a buffer (pH 6) which was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with continuous stirring at 300 rpm. Sufficient quantity of each formulation was applied uniformly on the entire surface of the skin (stratum corneum) in the donor compartment. After 24 h, the leftover of each formulation was removed from the surface of the skin with a cotton swab, cleaned carefully using 50% v / v ethanol in water and then, the total dosing area (0.636 cm 2 ) was excised using a biopsy punch. The amount of drug deposited in the skin tissue was estimated by HPLC.
In vitro Drug Release Study
For the in vitro drug release studies, a semi-permeable dialysis membrane of molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 14 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich Co, MO) was used. The membrane was mounted between the donor and receiver compartments of the Franz diffusion cells as done for the skin and sufficient quantity of formulation (Qu (0.12%) nanogel) was applied to cover the entire surface of the membrane in the donor compartment. The receiver compartment was filled with buffer (pH 6) and maintained as mentioned above for the skin disposition study. Three hundred microliter samples were taken from the receiver compartment and replaced with fresh buffer solution at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h. Further, the samples were analyzed by HPLC for the amount of released drug.
Skin Cancer Chemoprevention Study
The UV-induced skin cancer model was developed in SKH-1 hairless female mice in accordance with the established methods of Katiyar et al . ( , ) with modifications. Briefly, the animals were divided into 7 groups ( n = 5): Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), TiO 2 (15%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%), No UV-No drug, and UV only. Formulations were applied topically to mice for 6 days prior to the start of the study. Following this, mice were pretreated with nanogel on alternate days (3× a week) 2 h prior to UV irradiation exposure (180 mJ) for 6 months. The UV-only and No UV-No drug groups were kept as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The animals were irradiated from a band of UVB lamps (Daavlin, UVA/UVB Research Irradiation Unit, Bryan, OH) that was equipped with an electronic regulator for UV dosage control. The UV lamps produced UVB (290–320 nm) predominantly with less of UVA and UVC rays.
The average numbers of tumor nodule and average tumor volume were recorded for each animal every week for the entire duration of the chemoprevention study. Tumors that were persistent and at least 1 mm in size were recorded. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed and their dorsal skin was excised and subjected to molecular analysis.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to measure the expressions of critical proteins involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and cell cycle inhibition in skin photocarcinogenesis. Briefly, the skin samples were homogenized in a mixture of protease inhibitor (PI), RIPA lysis buffer, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on ice. Further, the protein concentration was estimated using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit according to established protocol. Fifty microgram of the protein lysate was then loaded onto a gel and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after which, the protein bands were transferred onto membrane blots. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies for Cox-2, EP3, EP4, cycline D1, PCNA, and β-actin and detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies using the BioRad ChemiDoc™ XRS+ imaging system (Hercules, CA, USA) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Statistical Analysis
All of the results of the study have been expressed as the mean ± standard deviation for at least three repetitions. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the comparison among multiple groups followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test while student’s t test analysis was used for the comparison between two groups. The mean differences were considered significant in all experiments valued at * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.
RESULTS
Development and Evaluation of Qu Nanocrystals
Optimization of Qu Concentration
Formulations containing 0.08–0.20% drug concentration were processed in HPH at a constant pressure of 30,000 psi for 2 cycles. Our results demonstrated that drug concentration below 0.16% produced nanocrystals in the size range of 249.65 ± 2.84 to 490.90 ± 2.37 with PI in the range of 0.325 ± 0.06 to 0.509 ± 0.03, whereas, at above 0.16% drug concentration, the nanocrystal particle size increased to 899.6 ± 4.19 nm with PI of 0.762 ± 0.03. Therefore, the range of 0.08–0.16% was selected as the optimum concentration range of the drug (Table 1 in supplementary data).
Optimization of HPH Pressure
Qu-formulations processed at pressure below 20,000 psi for two cycles produced nanocrystals with a particle size ˃ 600 nm. Formulations processed at or above 20,000-psi pressure showed a significant ( p < 0.001) effect on the particle size and PI in contrast to below 20,000-psi pressure. The particle size was reduced from 749.20 ± 3.94 when processed at 2500 psi to 249.65 ± 2.84 at 30,000-psi pressure. Therefore, the pressure range was optimized to 20,000–30,000 psi to avoid more exposure to high temperature (Table 2 in supplementary data).
Optimization of Organic Solvent Concentration
Formulations consisting of organic solvent from 1 to 3 ml (4–12%) were processed in HPH at 20,000–30,000 psi. The data revealed that all the formulations produced nanocrystals with a particle size in the range between 249.65 ± 2.84 and 263.71 ± 3.81 nm. Further, the PI was in the range of 0.309 ± 0.05 to 0.328 ± 0.03. Therefore, the range of the solvent concentration was optimized to 4–12% (Table 3 in supplementary data).
Design of Experiment
Qu nanocrystals were optimized by using three independent variables: drug concentration (A), organic solvent concentration (B), and HPH pressure (C). Particle size, PI, zeta potential, and drug assay were recorded for different batches of nanocrystals and analyzed by ANOVA (Table II ). P values < 0.05 were considered significant. The quadratic model was found to have best fit and the higher cubic model was found to be aliased for the particle size and PI whereas, the linear model was found to have best fit for drug assay. Table II DOE and results of all the run of nanocrystals Run Drug concentration (%) Organic solvent concentration (%) HPH pressure (PSI) Particle size (nm) PI Zeta potential (mv) Assay (%) 1 0.12 12.00 20,000 419.02 0.471 − 23.12 92.49 2 0.12 12.00 30,000 349.13 0.451 − 19.29 89.45 3 0.08 8.00 30,000 241.21 0.321 − 18.00 89.26 4 0.08 4.00 25,000 261.07 0.325 − 19.30 90.47 5 0.08 12.00 25,000 258.12 0.329 − 19.98 90.74 6 0.12 8.00 25,000 384.26 0.451 − 21.32 91.02 7 0.12 8.00 25,000 380.31 0.421 − 25.20 90.98 8 0.16 12.00 25,000 520.11 0.569 − 25.30 91.07 9 0.12 4.00 20,000 412.30 0.475 − 21.34 92.72 10 0.12 8.00 25,000 371.24 0.45 − 18.94 91.39 11 0.12 8.00 25,000 376.19 0.449 − 21.23 89.01 12 0.12 4.00 30,000 352.05 0.453 − 21.78 89.26 13 0.08 8.00 20,000 289.03 0.319 − 19.00 92.79 14 0.12 8.00 25,000 382.14 0.441 − 24.00 90.87 15 0.16 8.00 30,000 490.27 0.501 − 24.98 89.38 16 0.16 4.00 25,000 512.29 0.561 − 24.51 91.58 17 0.16 8.00 20,000 589.34 0.572 − 25.00 92.46
From ANOVA, A , C , AC, A 2 , and C 2 variables were significantly affecting the particle size of Qu nanocrystals. This signifies that drug concentration and HPH pressure had a quadratic effect whereas organic solvent concentration had a linear effect and AC is a two-way interaction. Drug concentration showed a significant ( p < 0.0001) effect on the particle size and PI. As drug concentration increased, the particle size increased. However, the increase in the organic solvent concentration did not show a significant effect on the particle size, PI, and zeta potential. HPH pressure also showed a significant ( p < 0.0001) effect on the particle size and PI. The particle size and PI decreased with the increase in HPH pressure.
From ANOVA, only C variable affected the assay significantly which indicates that HPH pressure had a linear effect and drug concentration and organic solvent concentration did not affect the percent assay. As the HPH pressure increased, the percent assay decreased significantly ( p < 0.001). All the affecting factors were optimized within the range chosen for design matrix construction. Constraints were applied to obtain the particle size to be minimized as optimized formulation from this design was to be used for further studies (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 a 3D plots showing the increase in particle size with the increase in the drug concentration and no effect of HPH pressure on particle size. b 3D plots showing no effect on drug assay on increase in drug concentration and HPH pressure. c 3D plot showing desirability factor on assay of Qu nanocrystals
Optimization of Qu nanocrystals was based on the desirability function in the range of 0 to 1 for worst response parameters to the best response parameters respectively. The batch with the highest desirability was selected for the prediction of responses of the model and to compare it with the actual results. Further, the optimized formulation was repeated three times and the results were compared with predicted responses. Data showed no significant difference between the predicted and experimental values. Two formulations of Qu were optimized: one with low concentration (0.08%) and the other with high concentration (0.12%) were selected for further studies (Tables 4 and 5 in supplementary data).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The SEM image showed that the Qu drug nanocrystals were rod-shaped. The particle size of the nanocrystals was below 400 nm (Fig. 2a ). Fig. 2 a Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of Qu nanocrystals showing rod-shaped particles with particle size ˂ 400 nm. b Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of Qu nanocrystals and Qu API showing the nanocrystals are stable after processing through HPH at high temperature and high pressure. c Effect of temperature on viscosity of gel showing decrease in viscosity on increase in temperature initially up to 50 (1/s) shear rate and then no effect of temperature on viscosity
Drug Assay in the Formulation
Drug content in Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogels was 89.27 ± 1.39%, 90.38 ± 1.81%, 90.05 ± 1.28% and 90.19 ± 1.41% respectively.
Differential Scanning Calorimetric Analysis
The DSC thermograms revealed that Qu was stable and intact when its nanocrystals were formed (Fig. 2b ). The drug showed a broadened endothermic peak between 300 and 310°C which is exactly similar to the drug’s nanocrystal peak.
Rheological Studies
As shown in Fig. 2c , viscosity of nanogel containing 0.12% Qu +15% TiO 2 at 25°C, 31°C, 40°C, and 50°C was 9.54 ± 0.91 Pa. s, 5.50 ± 1.25 Pa. s, 3.18 ± 0.98 Pa. s, and 2.45 ± 0.72 Pa. s respectively. Data revealed that viscosity decreased as the temperature increased. All nanogel formulations showed the same effect of temperature on the viscosity; therefore, only the nanogel containing 0.12% Qu and 15% TiO 2 has been shown in the result.
In vitro Drug Release Study
In vitro drug release study showed 72.39 ± 3.40% drug release from the Qu (0.12%) nanogel compared to Qu suspension. No drug release was detected from Qu suspension (Fig. 3a ). Further, Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel also showed drug release over 70% within 24 h. Fig. 3 a In vitro drug release study showing 72.39 ± 3.40% drug release from Qu (0.12%) nanogel whereas no drug release from Qu suspension. b In vitro skin deposition study showing significantly high drug deposition in Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogels compared with Qu suspension
In vitro Skin Deposition Study
The results of the skin deposition study have been presented in Fig. 3b . The data revealed that Qu (0.08%), Qu (0.12%), Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%), and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogels showed 0.06 ± 0.01, 0.09 ± 0.07, 0.07 ± 0.06 and 0.07 ± 0.05 mg of a drug deposition /gm of skin in contrast to Qu suspension which did not show drug deposition.
Skin Cancer Chemoprevention Studies
Pretreatment of the SKH-1 mice with Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel prior to UV exposure delayed tumorigenesis by 2 weeks compared with the UV-exposed animal group. Whereas, TiO 2 (15%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) nanogel, Qu (0.08%) nanogel, and Qu (0.12%) nanogel delayed tumorigenesis by 1 week each compared with the UV only group. Further, the percentage of animals that showed tumors at onset of tumorigenesis for the UV only group and Qu (0.08%) nanogel was about 80.0% while for Qu (0.12%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) nanogel, and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel pretreatments, the percentages estimated were 60.0%, 60.0%, and 20% respectively. Also, the pretreatment with Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel significantly ( p < 0.01) reduced the average cumulative number of tumors formed by 3.63-fold than the UV only group. At the end of 24 weeks, the recorded average numbers of tumors were 13.80 ± 2.96, 10.20 ± 3.75, 5.40 ± 3.44, 5.49 ± 0.93, 5.38 ± 3.94, and 3.80 ± 1.20 for UV only, Qu (0.08%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) nanogel, TiO 2 (15%) nanogel, Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) nanogel, and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel, respectively. Further, pretreatment with Qu nanogel (0.12%), TiO 2 (15%) nanogel, and Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (5%) nanogel significantly ( p < 0.001) decreased the average tumor volume compared with the UV only group. The Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%)-pretreated group developed very small tumor nodules which could not be measured by a vernier caliper suggesting its significant ( p < 0.001) effect on average tumor volume (Fig. 4 ).

Western Blot Analysis
Western blot results revealed that there was a significant ( p < 0.01) decrease in the expression of COX-2 enzyme with the Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel–treated group. Further, pretreatment with Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel, significantly ( p < 0.001) downregulated the expressions of PCNA and cyclin D1. Additionally, there was a significant ( p < 0.001) decrease in the EP3 and EP4 levels after the Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel pretreatment which showed that it could decrease the inflammation induced by UVB radiation. Our data also showed that the Qu (0.12%) alone group significantly ( p < 0.01) decreased EP3, ( p < 0.001) EP4, ( p < 0.001) cyclin D1, and ( p < 0.05) PCNA expressions. Moreover, the TiO 2 (15%) alone group significantly ( p < 0.001) downregulated EP4 and cyclin D1 expressions. Further, there was no significant effect on COX2, EP3, and PCNA expressions after pretreatment with the TiO 2 (15%) alone group. The Qu (0.12%) alone group did not show a significant effect on COX2 expression. Overall, combination of Qu and TiO 2 significantly ( p < 0.001) downregulated the expressions of EP3 and EP4, PCNA, and cyclin D1 in contrast to the Qu alone and TiO 2 alone groups (Fig. 5 ).

DISCUSSION
Observational and analytic epidemiologic findings have consistently shown that increased cumulative sun exposure is a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer ( , , ). Skin exposure with UV radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development ( ). Sunscreens have been widely used to protect the skin from the UV radiations. However, it has been reported that certain chemicals used in sunscreens (ex. oxybenzone, octylmethoxycinnamate, and homosalate) may disrupt the hormonal system. The hypothesis of the present study is that Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) combination nanogel will serve dual purpose for preventing non-melanoma skin cancer. The premise here is that inorganic TiO 2 will significantly reduce the UVB exposure to the skin while presence of Qu in dermis will be helpful in preventing UVB-induced oxidative damage. Further, Qu nanocrystal will overcome the extremely poor solubility and permeability-related issues of Qu. Therefore, we have developed Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel for the chemoprevention of photocarcinogenesis and to enhance the permeation of Qu. Results of the current study evidently support the role of Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) combination nanogel in inhibition of photo carcinogenesis caused by UVB radiation exposure and further demonstrate the molecular pathways blocked by Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) combination to prevent the UV-induced photocarcinogenesis.
In this study, the formulation of nanogel is divided into three steps: first to formulate the Qu nanocrystals using HPH which works at high pressure to reduce the particle size. Second to homogenize the TiO 2 and Qu mixture using a microprocessor and third, to add the gelling agent HPMC, and humectants using a propeller. The Box-Behnken design approach was applied for optimization of the nanocrystal formulation since it requires fewer design points and allowed us to work around extreme factor combination ( ). First, preliminary studies were carried out to optimize various factors related to the HPH equipment and material used in the formulation. Drug concentration range, HPH pressure, and organic solvent concentration range were optimized before applying the Box-Behnken design. Further, drug concentration, HPH pressure, and organic solvent concentration were selected as variables and particle size, PI, zeta potential, and drug assay were selected as response parameters in the design.
Preliminary and Box-Behnken design results demonstrated that drug concentration and HPH pressure affected the quality of nanocrystal formulation. Results revealed that HPH pressure showed a significant ( p < 0.0001) effect on the particle size and PI. Our results are in concordance with the study by Petra Furedi et al ., where they found that high HPH pressure reduced the particle size and PI of lipid based nanoparticles. Particle size and PI decreased with the increase in HPH pressure which might be because of exposure of the particles to very high shear stress causing reduction of the particle size. Further, they found that high pressure requires less number of cycles which is desired for thermolabile drugs since high pressure generates heat in HPH ( ). Data also showed that the particle size and PI were affected significantly ( p < 0.0001) by the concentration of drug present in the formulation which might be due to the increase in the solid content in the formulation. Other investigator also demonstrated the effect of drug concentration on the particle size of nanoparticle. Pradhan et al . showed that drug concentration significantly affected the particle size of triamcinolone-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier for topical treatment of psoriasis ( ). Organic solvent concentration did not show a significant effect on the particle size and PI because of high drug solubility in THF. It is well reported in the literature that if a drug has high solubility in a specific solvent, adding more drug does not increase the drug concentration in the solution ( ). Results also showed that percent assay significantly decreased ( p < 0.0001) with the increase in HPH pressure which might be because of loss of drug at high temperature.
The scanning electron microscopy image revealed that the nanocrystals are of rod shaped and are of particle size below 400 nm. Sahoo et al . demonstrated the needle-shaped morphology of Qu nanocrystals with a particle size below 500 nm where they formulated the nanocrystals by high pressure homogenization and a lyophilization technique ( ). Differential scanning calorimetry result revealed that both Qu nanocrystals and Qu API showed the sharp endothermic peak between 300 and 310°C suggesting that Qu nanocrystals are stable and not degraded at high pressure and high temperature while processing through HPH. Onoue et al . demonstrated that both curcumin nanocrystals and crystalline curcumin showed intense melting endotherm at 180°C in the DSC data ( ). Rheology data revealed that as the temperature increases viscosity decreases until a certain point and after that, temperature does not have any effect on viscosity which confirmed that nanogel first followed a non-Newtonian flow and after a certain point Newtonian flow. It has been well reported that the temperature affects the viscosity ( ). Higher drug release from Qu nanogel compared with Qu suspension in the in vitro release profile confirmed that a small particle size and large surface area helps to release more drug through the dialysis membrane. Onoue et al . showed the enhanced drug release of curcumin from curcumin nanocrystal formulation in contrast to crude curcumin ( ). Further, ex vivo deposition results showed higher drug deposition in the skin from all the nanogel formulations compared with Qu suspension which was again because of its low particle size and high surface area. Deposition results are supported by our previous work with DIM-D (1,1-bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl) methane, diindolylmethane derivative) where DIM-D-UltraFLEX-Nano formulated with HPMC matrix gel pronouncedly enhanced the skin deposition of DIM-D more than the aqueous dispersion since DIM-D is water insoluble ( ). In addition to this, Xianbing Zhu et al . have reported that Qu-loaded PLGA-TPGS NPs hydrogel deposited Qu in stratum corneum and epidermis/dermis ( ).
Further, Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel significantly reduced inflammation caused by UVB radiation exposure . In vivo chemoprevention study revealed that at the time of tumorigenesis, the average number of tumor nodule and average tumor volume were significantly reduced in the Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel group compared with all other groups which confirms that Qu and TiO 2 at its optimum concentration could successfully reduce the UV-induced inflammation and tumorigenesis. This might be because TiO 2 prevented the UVB radiation from penetrating into the skin layers. It is reported that TiO 2 acts as a UV filter by scattering, reflecting/absorbing the UV radiation ( https://www.livescience.com/32666-how-does-sunscreen-work.html ). Also, Qu might have prevented the oxidation caused by UVB exposure. A study by Xianbing Zhu et al . also reported the chemopreventive activity of Qu, as they found a significant decrease in epidermal thickness caused by UV radiation exposure ( ). Our previous work on a natural antioxidant compound DIM-D supported the present results in chemoprevention study where Qu, an antioxidant flavonoid played an important role in prevention of tumor occurrence and its growth ( ). Pre-application of topical Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel significantly reduced the UV-induced inflammation which causes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventually lead to mutation. Downregulation of COX-2, EP3, and EP4 confirmed that Qu and TiO 2 combination has helped in reducing inflammation which eventually prevents tumorigenesis. Our results are in concordance with the study done by Xianbing Zhu et al ., wherein they demonstrated that Qu blocked UVB-induced COX-2 expression in Hacat cell line ( ). In a study by Prasad et al., mechanism of UV-induced suppression of the immune system or contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response was investigated to determine whether UV-induced suppression of CHS is linked with enhancement of the inflammation. Their results revealed that UV-exposed mouse skin showed 2.5-fold higher expression of COX-2 along with high expression of PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) compared with non-UVB-exposed skin. ( , ). Significant downregulation of PCNA and cyclin D1 by Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) nanogel in contrast to nanogel containing Qu only suggests that Qu and TiO 2 combination inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle inhibition more effectively than the Qu and TiO 2 alone group. Sivrikoz et al . studied cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expressions in BCC-diagnosed patients. Their results showed that higher cyclin D1 expression in aggressive BCC tumors could be used as a marker for the prediction of the aggressive behavior of BCCs ( , ). Further, our results are in concordance with a study by Vaid et al . in which they evaluated the inhibitory effect of honokiol, a phytochemical from the magnolia plant, on UVB-induced photocarcinogenesis. Their immunohistochemical analysis showed that PCNA expression was significantly decreased on treatment of mouse skin with honokiol compared with non-treated UVB-irradiated skin indicating inhibition of proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes. ( ). Collectively, the results from this study suggest that Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) combination could significantly inhibit UVB-induced photocarcinogenesis and hence can be further explored.
CONCLUSION
Overall, novel combination of Qu (0.12%) + TiO 2 (15%) showed promising results with enhanced skin deposition of Qu and a significant decrease in average number of tumor nodules, time of tumorigenesis, and average tumor volume in in vivo chemoprevention study, Further, our molecular studies showed significant downregulation of COX2, EP3, EP4, cyclin D1, and PCNA expressions suggesting the possible mechanism to be through the interference in inflammatory and cell cycle pathways. Although, the findings of the current study showed a significant decrease in photocarcinogenesis, our future strategy will be to use the combination of inorganic compounds, e.g., TiO 2 and ZiO 2 along with antioxidant compound for chemoprevention of UVB-induced skin cancer.
