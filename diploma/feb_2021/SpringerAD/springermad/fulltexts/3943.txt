Introduction
With respect to pharmacokinetics, it is an impossible challenge to create one drug molecule that will be safe and effective for all people. A more realistic approach is to predict which subgroups of patients may be at risk of poor safety or efficacy. For this approach, the characteristics that may predispose an individual to high or low exposure must be determined. In other words, we must determine the key factors that contribute to inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability.
Using conventional “top-down” pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling we can identify general pharmacokinetic differences between individuals based on covariates such as age, sex, size, ethnicity, organ function and disease progression. The main limitation of the popPK method is that we cannot determine the impact of a covariate until it has been measured in a study population and the resulting clinical pharmacokinetic data has been analyzed.
In contrast, “bottom-up” population physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (popPBPK) modelling enables us to simulate the impact of covariates with virtual populations. General covariates identified through popPK methods (e.g., ethnicity) may be surrogates for variability in underlying physiologic processes (e.g., genetic variant of a transporter). If a PBPK model accounts for all significant physiologic processes that affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug, then it follows that the total variability observed in pharmacokinetic data should be the output of inter-individual variability around each key process or parameter. This approach to quantifying variability is knowledge-driven rather than data-driven.
In this work we propose a framework for quantifying and predicting inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. We demonstrate the utility of popPBPK modelling to complement conventional popPK methods with a study of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab. Key factors that contribute to variability will be identified and interpreted in tandem with a previous popPK analysis by Bruno et al. [ ]. Conclusions will enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of variability and prompt new questions about patient subgroups that may be at risk of poor safety or efficacy.
Methods
The primary aim of the research was to determine the factors that contribute to inter-individual variability in trastuzumab pharmacokinetics for both healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients. The following workflow was used:
Part One: mean analysis
1. Model development: construction of an in silico whole-body PBPK model to describe the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab in a mean individual. 2. Model parameterization: estimation of model parameters based on existing literature. 3. Model fitting: optimization of uncertain parameters by fitting the model to the mean concentration–time profiles in experimental data. 4. Model evaluation: evaluation of the optimized model for a mean individual by predicting the mean concentration–time profiles from additional experimental data.
Part Two: variability analysis
5. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis: identification of key parameters that contribute to inter-individual variability, characterization of their contribution and assessment of parameter correlation. 6. Population simulation: development of a virtual population of unique individuals with literature-based variability around key parameters and simulation of plasma concentration–time data for the virtual population using the optimized model. 7. Analysis: comparison of the simulated inter-individual variability with the inter-individual variability observed in experimental data.
Software
A MATLAB extension called SBToolbox2 was used to automate the simulation of the system of ordinary differential equations and model analysis [ ]. The population generation tool was based in MATLAB and followed generally the method of Willmann et al. [ ].
Results
Part One: mean analysis
1. Model development
An in silico whole body model to describe the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab in a mean individual was developed based on the platform model for a monoclonal antibody (mAb) by Shah and Betts [ ]. A schematic for the structure of the model is shown in Fig. 1 . Figure 2 illustrates the mechanistic processes affecting mAb pharmacokinetics within each tissue compartment. Previous PBPK models by Cao and Jusko, Li et al., and Glassman and Balthasar have successfully characterized the nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile of trastuzumab [ , , ]. Fig. 1 A schematic for the whole body PBPK model showing the connection of anatomical compartments by blood flow ( solid line ) and lymph flow ( dashed line ) Fig. 2 An illustration of the physiologic processes affecting the movement of trastuzumab through each organ and sub-compartment
Shedding of the HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) was modelled as proposed by Li et al. with the following modifications [ ]: ECD concentrations were assumed constant (rate of synthesis equal to rate of degradation) The concentration in the interstitial space was assumed equal to the measured concentration in plasma mAb-ECD complex circulation was assumed to be similar to mAb circulation, but with pinocytotic uptake being negligible
Antigen kinetics were determined from existing mechanistic models for HER2 trafficking that incorporated in vitro measurements [ , , , , , ]. Derivation of the antigen degradation term ( \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) ) can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. The concentration of membrane-bound HER2 antigen was kept constant (rate of synthesis equal to rate of degradation) because trastuzumab binding does not induce internalization or degradation of the receptor [ , , , , , , ]. The model can apply to both healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients by toggling a tumour compartment on and off. The tumour compartment was connected by blood and lymph flow to the whole body circulation for cancer simulations. Model equations can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. 2. Model parameterization
Reference values for anatomical parameters were obtained from BioDMET documents [ ] and can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. The volumes of the organ sub-compartments (plasma space, endosomal space and interstitial space) were calculated for each organ based on the fractions used in the platform model [ ]. Lymph flow in each organ, aside from the lung, was set to 0.2% of plasma flow [ ]. Lymph flow in the lung was set to 3% of total body lymph flow in agreement with Gill et al. [ ].
Experimental plasma concentration–time data was collected from seven pharmacokinetic studies with trastuzumab and its biosimilars. Biosimilars are pharmacokinetic equivalents of trastuzumab and were included because of the sparse data available for trastuzumab. Table 1 lists the trials and corresponding demographic information. The graphs were digitized using the Plot Digitizer v2.6.8 application by Joseph Huwaldt [ ].

When using the model to simulate the mean concentration–time profile with one representative virtual individual, anatomical parameters were scaled from the reference values so that the virtual individual’s characteristics matched the mean height, weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), gender, cancer status and ECD level of individuals in the experimental trial [ ]. A tumour with a volume of 20 mL was added to the representative individual for simulations of trials with breast cancer patients. Tumour parameters were extracted from a previous model for trastuzumab and are available in the Supplementary Appendix [ ]. A description of mechanistic model parameters can be found in Table 2 .

The concentration of HER2 in normal tissues was measured to be 10,000 receptors/cell [ ]. The following calculation was applied, assuming 3.27 × 10 13 cells/body and a cellular volume of 53.6 L/body, giving a concentration of 10.1 nM in cells [ ]. $$Ag_{body}^{C} = \frac{{\left( {1 \times 10^{4} \frac{receptors}{cell}} \right)\left( {3.27 \times 10^{13} \frac{cells}{body}} \right)}}{{\left( {6.02 \times 10^{23} \frac{receptors}{mol}} \right)\left( {53.6\frac{L cells}{body}} \right)}}$$
However, HER2 is a membrane-bound protein and the concentration of HER2 ( \(Ag\) ) for the model input must be in terms of interstitial volume ( \(V^{IS}\) ) to enable stoichiometric binding of mAbs in the interstitial space. There are also limitations to HER2 accessibility. First, one third of HER2 receptors are internalized in the cell and inaccessible for binding while two thirds are present on the membrane [ , ]. Furthermore, accessibility is impaired by dimerization. Up to 95% of membrane-bound HER2 is homo- and heterodimerized with members of the HER family [ , ]. The HER2 extracellular domain is approximately 100 kDa and trastuzumab is 145.5 kDa in size [ ]. Dimer linkages occur between the respective subdomain II regions of monomers. Trastuzumab binds to subdomain IV, which is closest to the membrane and is overshadowed by subdomain II [ ]. An analysis of crystal structures suggests that subdomain IV is blocked when HER2 is dimerized by a linkage across subdomain II [ ]. Therefore in our model, the concentration of membrane-bound HER2 available for high affinity binding in each organ was assumed to be the concentration of monomers only (~5% of membrane-bound HER2) and was calculated by: $$Ag_{organ} = 10.1\,nM \times \frac{{V_{organ}^{C} }}{{V_{organ}^{IS} }} \times \frac{2}{3} membrane \ bound \times 0.05 \,monomers$$ 3. Model fitting
SBtoolbox2 was used to globally fit the model for a mean individual to the mean plasma concentration–time profiles for trastuzumab in the datasets from Wisman et al. and Yin et al. with a simulated annealing method (see Table 1 ) [ , ]. Glassman and Balthasar identified that the rate of convective flow through pores and the rate of endocytic transport ( \(CL_{up}\) ) are drug-specific and require fitting [ ]. A scaling factor ( \(F2\) ) was used for the fit to describe the convective flow through pores according to: $$Convective \, Flow = F2 \times (1 - \sigma^{V} ) \times L$$
The fitted values for \(F2\) and \(CL_{up}\) were 3.35 and 0.0188 L/h/L respectively. Figure 3 shows two model-fitted profiles using data from Wisman et al. and Yin et al. [ , ]. The optimized model for a mean individual accurately characterizes the non-linear shape of the mean pharmacokinetic profiles. Fig. 3 A comparison of the model-fitted profile for a mean individual ( solid line ) with the experimental data ( diamond ) in healthy males from Wisman et al. ( a ) and Yin et al. ( b ) [ , ] 4. Model evaluation
The remaining datasets for trastuzumab and its biosimilars in Table 1 were used to validate the optimized model for mean individuals. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the observed mean plasma concentrations to the model-predicted mean plasma concentrations for all evaluation datasets, which include a variety of dose levels and administration protocols. Fig. 4 Model-predicted vs. observed concentrations for healthy males ( circle ) and females with breast cancer ( diamond ). The observed concentrations come from the experimental trials listed in Table 1 (not bolded)
Predictions for mean individuals were strong with an R 2 of 0.967 when simulating mean pharmacokinetic profiles for both healthy males and females with breast cancer. The model trended toward an overestimation of trastuzumab plasma concentrations at levels below 200 nM and an underestimation of trastuzumab plasma concentrations at levels above 1200 nM in patients with cancer.
Part Two: variability analysis
With a validated model in place that adequately predicts mean concentration–time profiles, we turned our attention to analyze variability. Further analyses were done with parameter values as determined for the validated model, which include the fitted values for \(F2\) and \(CL_{up}\) . 5. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
A local sensitivity analysis that accounts for the variability around each parameter that is seen in a general population allows for an assessment of the importance of each parameter in defining total inter-individual variability (See Table 2 ). The sigma-normalized sensitivity coefficient ( \(S_{p}^{\sigma }\) ) is a measure of the anticipated percent change in AUC with a perturbation of one standard deviation ( \(\sigma_{p}\) ) in the mean parameter value ( \(p\) ). The sigma-normalized sensitivity coefficient ( \(S_{p}^{\sigma }\) ) was calculated by: $$S_{p}^{\sigma } = \left| {\frac{{AUC\left( {p \pm \sigma_{p} } \right) - AUC(p)}}{AUC(p)}} \right| \times 100\%$$
Key parameters that contribute to inter-individual variability were identified by \(S_{p}^{\sigma } \ge 1\) . If a parameter has a sigma-normalized sensitivity coefficient of 1, then an individual possessing a parameter value that is one standard deviation higher or lower than the mean value will have an AUC that is 1% different than the mean AUC of the population. We deem that this difference is the cut-off for declaring a parameter important for accounting for interindividual variability. The literature-defined variability in terms of a coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter is listed in Table 2 . Of note, the CV for \(FcRn\) is based on the variability in PBPK model estimates to date and the CV for \(F2\) was dependent on cancer status (see Table 1 ). Figure 5 shows that the five key parameters are the rate of endocytic transport ( \(CL_{up}\) ), the rate of convective flow through pores ( \(F2\) ), the concentration of membrane-bound HER2 accessible for binding ( \(Ag\) ), the degradation rate of HER2 and mAb-HER2 complexes ( \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) ) and the concentration of ECD ( \(ECD\) ). The magnitudes of the effects of the key parameters on the model remain similar whether the parameters are increased or decreased by one standard deviation. Body mass ( \(BM\) ) was included in this analysis for comparative purposes. The result suggests that physically varying body mass (changing organ size and flow rates) has a minor effect on plasma concentrations when dosing is normalized to body mass (mg/kg). Fig. 5 Sigma-normalized local sensitivity coefficients ( \(\varvec{S}_{\varvec{p}}^{\varvec{\sigma}}\) ) determined for each mechanistic parameter in the model, and body mass (see Table 2 ). Key parameters were identified by \(\varvec{S}_{\varvec{p}}^{\varvec{\sigma}} \ge 1\)
The sigma-normalized local sensitivity of the model to each key parameter over the entire time series was analyzed in Fig. 6 . The convective flow through pores ( \(F2\) ) was the most important parameter governing trastuzumab distribution into tissues and primarily affected variability in the first 500 h post-administration. The concentration of HER2 ( \(Ag\) ) was the most significant contributor to variability in clearance. \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) plays a significant role in elimination as expected. The effects of \(ECD\) are small overall. Fig. 6 The effect of each key parameter on plasma concentration over time when perturbed by ± one standard deviation, expressed as the absolute difference in plasma concentration between the perturbed simulation and the nominal simulation at every time point
Next, we carried out a global variance-based sensitivity analysis to quantify the contribution of select parameters ( \(CL_{up}\) , \(F2\) , \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) , \(Ag\) , \(ECD\) and \(FcRn)\) to total variability in terms of the effect on plasma AUC. \(FcRn\) was included as an insensitive parameter for a comparative control. The global sensitivity analysis quantifies the variability attributed to each key parameter individually (first order effects) as well as the total variability caused by the parameter when additionally considering its interactions with every other input parameter (total effects). We used Sobol’s method as proposed by Saltelli et al., which is described in the Supplementary Appendix [ ].
Figure 7 a shows that together, the first order effects of parameters \(CL_{up}\) , \(F2\) and \(Ag\) account for most of the total variability observed when the six parameters in Table 3 are allowed to vary both individually and in possible combination with each other. Figure 7 b contrasts the first order effects for each parameter with the total global effects, which occur when each parameter varies individually and in combination with the others. The first order effect of each parameter accounts for the vast proportion of its total effect. The difference between the total effect and first order effect sensitivity measure determines the degree of interaction between each parameter and the others. The difference between the total effects and first order effects are small, signifying a small degree of interaction between each of the analyzed parameters and the others. Fig. 7 a Shows that the first order effects of \(\varvec{Ag}\) , \(\varvec{F}2\) and \(\varvec{CL}_{{\varvec{up}}}\) make up most of the total variability. b Shows that the differences between the first order effects ( solid fill ) and total effects ( stripe fill ) for \(\varvec{Ag}\) , \(\varvec{F}2\) and \(\varvec{CL}_{{\varvec{up}}}\) are small Table 3 A summary of the inputs and the results for Sobol’s global sensitivity analysis Parameter Mean value Coefficient of variation (%) First order sensitivity \(\left( {S_{j} } \right)\) Total sensitivity \(\left( {S_{{T_{j} }} } \right)\) \(CL_{up}\) 0.0188 L/h/L 25 0.11 0.14 \(F2\) (cancer) 3.35 50 0.20 0.26 \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) 0.0789 h −1 33.3 0.02 0.06 \(Ag\) 1.6 nM 100 0.57 0.60 \(ECD\) 0.3 nM 100 ~0 0.02 \(FcRn\) 49,800 nM 15 ~0 0.01
Lastly, it is important to assess the identifiability of the key parameters which gives a measure of the confidence we can have that the values in the model are the true values. A parameter is identifiable within a model if it is theoretically possible to learn the true value after observing the model for an infinitely long time. SBtoolbox2 was used to create a parameter correlation matrix based on the method by Jacquez and Greif (Fig. 8 ) [ ]. Elements in the matrix that are close to 1 (Fig. 8 : white) indicate that it is not feasible to identify the true value of the corresponding parameters independently. Elements that are close to 0 (Fig. 8 : black) indicate that there is no correlation between the corresponding parameters and thus these parameters should be independently identifiable. As Fig. 8 indicates, \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) and \(Ag\) are correlated, meaning that we may be able to achieve a similar output profile with different combinations of values for these parameters. \(CL_{up}\) is also moderately correlated to these parameters. The information from Fig. 6 strengthens the understanding of these correlations. Figure 6 shows that the three parameters affect the model in similar ways over similar time periods. However, the peak effect of \(CL_{up}\) on the pharmacokinetic profile occurs earlier than the peak effects for \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) and \(Ag\) . Therefore, \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) and \(Ag\) are highly correlated to each other. The correlation of \(CL_{up}\) to \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) and \(Ag\) is weaker, but significant. Fig. 8 Matrix presenting the correlation between key parameters. A white colour suggests a strong correlation, while a black colour suggests no correlation between two parameters 6. Population simulation
Virtual populations with variability in anthropometric parameters (body mass, height, blood flow and hematocrit) similar to the anthropometric variability in each experimental sample were created using a population generation tool previously developed in the Edginton lab. Briefly, individuals for a population are randomly generated according to height and the associated standard deviation reported for the patient sample in the experimental trial. Organ masses are randomly generated from truncated distributions to prevent extreme outliers, and the resulting body mass and the BMI are calculated. If the calculated BMI is outside of the range provided for the patient sample in the experimental trial, this virtual individual is discarded. The resulting virtual population should have approximately the same mean and standard deviation for BMI, height and body mass as the patient sample.
Virtual individuals were used as inputs for the model and the simulated variability for the virtual population was compared to the actual observed variability in the datasets from Wisman et al., Morita et al., Baselga et al. and Cobleigh et al. [ , , , ]. Figure 9 shows the minimal impact of anthropometric variability alone on inter-individual variability in the presence of body-mass normalized dosing (mg/kg). As mentioned before, the model trended toward an over-prediction of trastuzumab plasma concentrations at levels below 200 nM in patients with cancer (Fig. 4 ). These overestimations are compounded after multiple weekly low doses in the trial by Cobleigh et al., resulting in a significant over-prediction of the mean trough level until plasma concentrations reach steady state (Fig. 9 d). Fig. 9 Plasma concentration vs. time profiles for a virtual population created with variability in anthropometric parameters alone. The resulting variability ( shaded fill ) was compared to the observed inter-individual variability ( solid error bar ) in Wisman et al. ( a ), Morita et al. ( b ), Baselga et al. ( c ) and Cobleigh et al. ( d ) [ , , , ]. In all cases, variability is reported as a standard deviation
Next, individuals in the virtual populations were modified to have a normal or lognormal distribution around key model parameter values ( \(F2\) , \(CL_{up}\) , \(Ag\) , \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) and \(ECD\) ) according to the coefficients of variation in Table 2 . The distributions for \(Ag\) and \(ECD\) were lognormal to encompass the wide spread of values seen in the literature [ , , ]. Since these five parameters are the most important for describing variability, they should capture the vast majority of the experimental variability together. The simulated variability was compared to the experimental variability in the datasets from Wisman et al., Morita et al., Baselga et al. and Cobleigh et al. in Fig. 10 [ , , , ]. Fig. 10 Plasma concentration vs. time profiles for a virtual population created with variability in anthropometric parameters plus literature-defined variability around the five key parameters ( \(\varvec{F}2\) , \(\varvec{CL}_{{\varvec{up}}}\) , \(\varvec{Ag}\) , \(\varvec{K}_{{\varvec{deg}}}^{{\varvec{Ag}}}\) and \(\varvec{ECD}\) ). The resulting variability ( shaded fill ) was compared to the observed inter-individual variability ( solid error bar ) in Wisman et al. ( a ), Morita et al. ( b ), Baselga et al. ( c ) and Cobleigh et al. ( d ) [ , , , ]. In all cases, variability is reported as a standard deviation
Overall, the framework enabled adequate predictions of the inter-individual variability in clinical trials by decomposing total variability into literature-based variability around each of the key parameters a priori (Fig. 10 ). However, the population model under-predicted variability in the first 72 h for healthy males (Fig. 10 a, b) and in the first cycles before steady state for females with breast cancer (Fig. 10 c, d). While the mean plasma concentration is over-predicted in the simulation for the trial by Cobleigh et al., an adequate prediction for the magnitude of the variability remains.
Discussion
Using the population PBPK modelling framework, five key parameters that contribute to inter-individual variability in trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were identified. In other words, patients who are outliers with respect to these five key parameters: 1. The concentration of membrane-bound HER2 accessible for binding ( \(Ag\) ) 2. The rate of convective flow of mAb through vascular pores from plasma to interstitial space ( \(F2\) ) 3. The rate of endocytic transport of mAb through vascular endothelial cells ( \(CL_{up}\) ) 4. The degradation rate of HER2 and mAb-HER2 complexes ( \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) ) 5. The concentration of shed HER2 ECD in the plasma and interstitial space ( \(ECD\) )
may be at risk for poor safety or efficacy with trastuzumab.
The next task is to assess the clinical relevance of each parameter. Can these parameters be measured in patients and if not, how are these parameters related to more measureable characteristics? In a review of inter-individual variability for all mAbs, Gill et al. highlighted ways that physiologic processes affecting mAb pharmacokinetics could be correlated to general covariates such as age, body mass, ethnicity and disease state [ ]. We expand on those insights here.
Total concentrations of HER2 vary widely in healthy and cancer populations and can be measured with the HERmark assay [ ]. This assay can also measure the concentration of HER2 homodimers, which enables a prediction for the concentration of HER2 that is accessible for mAb binding ( \(Ag\) ) [ ]. In the era of personalized medicine, measured levels of HER2 in tissues may be appropriate grounds for dose adjustments.
The rate of convective flow of mAb through pores ( \(F2\) ) is difficult to measure directly. However, Parving and colleagues have demonstrated that the flow of plasma proteins through capillaries can change proportionally to blood pressure and can be altered by liver cirrhosis, diabetes, congestive heart failure and inflammatory skin conditions [ , , , , , ]. The measured transcapillary escape rate (TER) of IgG and albumin in various disease states is summarized in Table 4 . Table 4 Values reported for the transcapillary escape rate (TER) of albumin and IgG in patients with various conditions Condition TER IgG (%/h, SD) TER albumin (%/h, SD) Healthy [ ] 3.0 (0.7) 5.2 (1.0) Hypertension a [ ] 4.7 (1.0) 7.8 (0.9) Short-term type 1 diabetes b [ ] 5.5 (1.0) Long-term type 1 diabetes c [ ] 4.4 (1.0) 7.4 (1.1) Liver cirrhosis [ ] 8.4 (0.8) 7.4 (1.9) Chronic right heart failure [ ] 8.3 (1.6) Inflammatory skin disease [ ] 8.6 (1.1) a Mean arterial blood pressure: 193/119 mmHg b Mean duration: 2.6 years c Mean duration: 20 years with microangiopathy
The presence of cancer may also impact the TER and the \(F2\) parameter. Cancer is an inflammatory disease that alters many homeostatic functions in the body. The liver is a common site of metastasis and damage may increase the TER and \(F2\) similar to cirrhosis [ ].
When \(F2\) increases there is a shift in distribution from plasma to tissue, while the final plasma trough concentrations remain similar (Fig. 6 ). Therefore we anticipate that patients with the conditions listed in Table 4 may experience greater tissue exposure along with possibly increased efficacy and toxicity. For example, a cancer patient with diabetes who is receiving trastuzumab may have greater penetration of the drug into heart tissue and may be at an increased risk for cardiotoxicity compared to a cancer patient without diabetes, even while trough concentrations are within normal therapeutic ranges for both patients. The results of a recent meta-analysis by Leung and Chan may support this hypothesis [ ]. They identify hypertension and diabetes (among other factors) as significant risk factors for cardiotoxicity in elderly females being treated with trastuzumab [ ].
The rate of endocytic transport ( \(CL_{up}\) ) of mAb through vascular endothelial cells is not well understood in modelling as estimates vary tenfold between groups [ , ]. It is the gateway by which mAb participates in FcRn binding and recycling. Genetic factors likely play the largest roles for determining \(CL_{up}\) for an individual [ , ]. Genotypic testing of FcRn, caveolin or other proteins involved in endocytosis may prove clinically relevant for dose adjustments.
Although not directly measurable, the degradation rate of HER2 and mAb-HER2 complexes ( \(K_{deg}^{Ag}\) ) is correlated with the internalization rate [ , ]. Hendriks showed that the internalization rate of HER2 depends on the presence of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand and the relative concentrations of HER1-4 on the cell membrane [ ]. The degradation rate may also be subject to genetic polymorphisms of the HER2 protein. Genotypic testing of HER2 may be useful for dosing to improve safety and efficacy.
The role of \(ECD\) as a predictor for response to trastuzumab therapy or tumour progression is still unknown. Carney et al. indicate that an increasing \(ECD\) level is a marker for poor prognosis, while a number of smaller studies show that an early increase in \(ECD\) level before trastuzumab treatment can predict a good response [ , , , , , , , ]. Because of the uncertainty and the overall small effect on variability, the clinical utility of \(ECD\) for predicting safety and efficacy is low.
Next, we compare our results from the popPBPK framework to existing results from a popPK study by Bruno et al. in patients with metastatic breast cancer [ ]. The group modelled the pharmacokinetics with a non-linear mixed effects model using two compartments [ ]. Variability in patient body mass, the number of metastatic sites and the concentration of serum extracellular domain were determined to be the most important factors for predicting the observed variability, but together failed to predict the large variability in the data [ ]. In the following analysis, we do not endeavour to contrast the work of Bruno et al. Rather we strive to gain a mechanistic understanding of their findings and of the overall variability in trastuzumab pharmacokinetics through PBPK modelling approaches.
First, they showed that the volume of distribution for trastuzumab changes as a function of body mass, ranging from 2.5L at 49 kg to 3.7L at 96 kg [ ]. These volumes correspond to the predicted plasma volume changes as a function of body mass (65 mL blood/kg for females, hematocrit 0.36–0.48). Body mass-normalized dosing eliminates any significant inter-individual variability, as shown in Fig. 9 . However, body mass is likely a surrogate covariate for variability in \(F2\) . People with higher body mass may be more likely to have diabetes, hypertension and microvascular damage, which can increase the convective flow of mAb through the blood vessel wall [ , , ]. Increased convective flow of mAb into tissues would result in a greater apparent volume of distribution.
Bruno et al. also demonstrated that patients with four or more metastatic sites had an 18% lower steady state exposure than those with up to three metastatic sites [ ]. In our model, patients with a total tumour volume of 80 mL had a 1.75% lower AUC than patients with a total tumour volume of 20 mL. The covariate effect cannot be reproduced through mechanistic PBPK modelling. This result suggests that the impact of more metastatic sites on clearance is not due to the physical effects of the tumour burden alone, but rather due to the increased disease burden on the whole body.
Because of its effects on clearance and volume of distribution, Bruno et al. predicted a 12% lower steady state exposure in a patient with a serum ECD level greater than 200 ng/mL compared to a patient with a serum ECD level of 8 ng/mL [ ]. Our model predicts an 8.3% lower AUC in a patient with a serum ECD level of 200 ng/mL compared to a patient with a serum ECD level of 8 ng/mL and a 12.0% lower AUC for a patient with a serum ECD level of 300 ng/mL. Therefore it is likely that the overall effect of ECD on trastuzumab clearance is directly mechanistic in nature. In other words, the effect of ECD on clearance and volume and distribution as quantified by Bruno et al. can be fully attributed to the physical mechanism where trastuzumab binds to ECD in the plasma or the interstitial space and is then cleared as an immune complex. We can be relatively certain that ECD does not affect the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab by indirect mechanisms.
Some modelling limitations were encountered. First, the model was built using data from healthy males and the same mean parameter values were extrapolated to females with breast cancer. While the model predictions were acceptable, improvements could be made by adjusting mean \(F2\) values based on disease state. Figure 11 shows how increasing the mean \(F2\) value by 50% for females with breast cancer relative to healthy males improves the accuracy of the model predictions for the mean data. Disease-specific mAb modelling using adjustments in the \(F2\) parameter will be warranted in the future. However, at the moment there is no reliable way to assign a mean \(F2\) value for a population according to cancer severity. Fig. 11 a Shows the model-predicted profiles and the experimental data in breast cancer patients from Tokuda et al. [ ]. b Shows the improved predictions when the mean \(\varvec{F}2\) value is increased by 50% to model the physiologic burden of cancer
Further, there are limitations surrounding our assumptions for ECD kinetics that could be improved with additional physiologic data in the future. The concentration of ECD in the interstitial space is largely uncertain. Moreover, we assume that the convective flow of the mAb-ECD complex is the same as naked mAb. The mAb-ECD complex is much larger than the naked mAb and it is likely restricted by pore size to a greater degree. Neither literature reports nor data are available to inform these two parameters at the present time.
Aside from the platform model by Shah and Betts, other recent models incorporate the competition of endogenous IgG for FcRn [ , , ]. The overall effect is that the accessible concentration of FcRn decreases. Because the platform model was parameterized without endogenous IgG independently characterized, adding this feature would compromise the internal validity of the other model parameter estimates. Shah and Betts state that it is an advantage that they have removed the characterization of endogenous IgG from their model [ ]. Figure 5 shows that the sensitivity of our model to accessible FcRn concentrations is relatively low in comparison to the key parameters and thus adding an FcRn modifier (i.e. endogenous IgG) would have little impact on model outcomes. The model could be improved by adding tissue-specific values for \(FcRn\) , though full measurements have only been established for mice [ ].
Finally, mass balance of fluid flow through the endosomal compartment requires the assumption that exactly half of the fluid taken up via endocytosis leaves endothelial cells via exocytosis, while the other half is sorted intracellularly for lysosomal processing before passively exiting the compartment. In the model equations, the fluid flow entering the endosomal compartment is \(2 \times CL_{up}\) L h −1 , while the fluid flow explicitly leaving the endosomal compartment is \(FR \times CL_{up} + \left( {1 - FR} \right) \times CL_{up} = CL_{up}\) L h −1 .
Conclusion
A popPBPK framework for quantifying inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability was proposed, tested and evaluated. Five key factors that contribute to inter-individual variability in trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were identified and the nature of their contribution was quantified with local and global sensitivity analyses. The clinical relevance of each of the five key parameters was explored. Simulations of plasma concentrations for virtual populations incorporating variability around each of the key parameters successfully predicted the inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability seen in experimental trials. The utility of popPBPK modelling to complement conventional popPK methods was demonstrated. Overall, our understanding of inter-individual variability in trastuzumab pharmacokinetics has been enhanced with knowledge about the underlying key mechanistic processes. We look to the clinical research community to apply this information as they formulate dosing strategies for patient subgroups that may be at risk for poor safety or efficacy with monoclonal antibody drugs.
