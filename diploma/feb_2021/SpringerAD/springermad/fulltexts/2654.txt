Introduction
Invertebrates including fishes they use the innate immune as a defense mechanism when they are exposed to any pathogens. The innate immune is a main role in the acquired immunity and body homeostasis (Magnadottir ). Lysozymes, humoral components that are an important type for prevention of various animals (invertebrate and vertebrate). This lytic enzyme is bactericidal, hydrolyzing b-linked glycoside bonds of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans (Fearon and Locksley ). In addition, lysozyme is able to disintegrate of both grams positive and negative bacteria. Moreover, the complement system and phagocytes are activated by opsonin which is a lysozyme (Jolles and Jolles ; Grinde ). Lysozyme occurs in various sources such as mucus, lymphoid tissue, and plasma of animals (Grinde et al. ; Lie et al. ). Many studies in innate immune system, the scientists had reported lysozyme activity used to evaluate immune status in fish, for example, Harikrishnan et al. ( ) reported that immunostimulants obtained by mixed herbal plants, Azadirachta indica , Oscimum sanctum ,and Curcuma longa were used to immune stimulation in goldfish ( Carassius auratus ); lysozyme activity was also used in this research. According to Dotta et al. ( ) they reported that the Nile tilapia was fed with natural extracts supplementation, propolis, and Aloe barbadensis to evaluate immune response; they used the lysozyme activity as an immune biomarker.
Three catfish: ( 1) hybrid catfish ( Clarias macrocephalus x Clarias gariepinus ), the most cultured fish in ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) including Thailand. The production in Thailand is about 50,000 tons/year (Areerat ), (2) Hemibagrus filamentus , widely distributed in the Mekong Basin while the maximum in total length could reach to 50 cm (Rainboth ), (3) Kryptopterus apogon , currently occured throughout of Southeast Asia including major river systems in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Peninsular Malaysia as well as the Greater Sunda Islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. The species show maximum length 130 cm. (Baird et al. ).
Two carps: (1) Oreochromis niloticus has been known about of its native strain in Africa and widely distributed in natural (Trewavas ). In 2005, annual production of caged tilapia over 22,000 tons was valued at about US$ 27 million in Thailand (Fisheries Information Technology Center ). Moreover, the global production of all tilapia is increased from 1.5–2.5 million tons within 7 years, 2003–2010 (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department ). (2) Channa striata , well known as snakehead fish, is a native air-breathing carnivorous fish. This species is widely distributed in various countries such as Pakistan to Thailand and south China (Ng and Lim ). This fish is highly preferred as food fish in the South and Southeast Asian countries (Wee and Tacon ).
Although these species are an importance for the aquaculture industry, on the contrary, there are limited information available on them especially lysozyme activity, the activity of this enzyme in various tissues and blood serum. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the basic knowledge of lysozyme activity in tissues (the brain, liver, and kidney) and serum in some commercial fish (hybrid catfish: H. filamentus , K. apogon , O.niloticus , and C. striata ). The investigation of lysozyme activity might provide some useful data for other researchers that could be used as biomarker from various tissues and serum as a biomarker related to the innate immune system, application to diagnose and monitor disease outbreaks by bacterial/virus pathogens in these species.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
Fifteen individuals apparently healthy mature hybrid catfish, C . macrocephalus x C . gariepinus (mean weight 500 ± 10.7 g, mean total length 25 ± 1.3 cm) and 15 farmed fish O . niloticus (mean weight 800 ± 13.4 g, mean total length 27 ± 1.9 cm) were bought from Ton Payom Market, Muang district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand (18° 47′ 26.41″ N; 98° 57′ 39.76″ E). Seven individuals H . filamentus (mean weight 650 ± 13.4 g, mean total length 29 ± 1.9 cm), seven K . apogon (mean weight 640 ± 30.2 g, mean total length 32 ± 4.5 cm), and nine C . striata (mean weight 550 ± 23.4 g, mean total length 25 ± 1.9 cm) were caught from Doi Tao Lake, Doi Tao district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand (17° 57′ 20.92″ N; 98° 39′ 23.76″ E).
Tissue preparations and extracts
All processes of tissue preparations were briefly undertaken at −4 o C. Fish were anesthetized by single pit method followed by 25 mg of each tissue (the brain, liver, and kidney). The tissues were cut and homogenized with 1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 6.0. After this, the tissues were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, and then supernatants were kept and stored in sterile serum tubes at −20 o C until used in the lysozyme activity study.
Serum preparation
One to two milliliters of blood sample from an individual fish was collected from the caudal vein using a syringe without anticoagulant to obtain the serum. For serum preparation, the blood was collected without anticoagulant in Eppendorf tubes and allowed to stand for overnight at 4 o C. The clot was then spun down at 3000 g for 10 min, and supernatants were stored in sterile serum tubes at −20 o C until used in the lysozyme activity study.
Serum lysozyme activity
Serum lysozyme activity was measured by using the turbidimetric method (Koskela et al. ) with some modifications. The maximum activity was detected in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, in which the substrate, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus , was suspended (3.0 mg/ml). Twenty-five microliters of each tissue extract and serum was added to 100 μl of the bacterial suspension. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm (ELISA reader) at intervals of 30 s (total measuring time 3 min) at 25 °C. The results were expressed as unit/ml which was computed by one unit of lysozyme activity, was defined as 0.001/min of the absorbance, and was reduced.
Statistical analysis
Data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variance before the analysis. The data were examined by using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test to the rank of the three catfish. The student’s t test ( P < 0.05) was used to analyze only two carp species. All data were presented as the mean and standard deviation. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software version 17 for Windows.

Discussion
Nowadays, many reports about the lysozyme activity have been used to evaluate health status in fish (innate immune system) when the fish live in different environmental conditions and is used to evaluate immunostimulants which were extracted from herbal plants (Tort et al. ; Dotta et al. ). All fish samples were used in this research showed normally healthy and no abnormality. After the lysozyme activity analysis, the highest was observed in serum, followed by the kidney but low in the liver and brain of both catfish and carp groups. On the other hand, Lie et al. ( ) reported that lysozyme activity in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri , was the highest in the kidney because that is hematopoietic portion, rich in leucocytes (monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils). They are are the main sources of lysozyme and followed in descending order by the alimentary tract, spleen, skin mucus, serum, gills, liver, and muscle, respectively. In addition, Sveinbjornsson et al. ( ) had detected lysozyme in the granules of the eosinophilic granular cells of the intestine. However, serum lysozyme is different by a seasonal variation, for example, serum lysozyme activity of Limanda limanda was minimal in fish sampled during the low-temperature period and maximal during the high-temperature period (Hutchinson and Manning ). According to Subbotkina and Subbotkin ( ), the lysozyme level in the organs and blood serum is different in representatives of different taxa. The lysozyme content and its distribution in visceral organs and serum depend on fish phylogeny but not on the type of vegetarian or predatory and the place of the constant habitation.
Our results showed that the serum lysozyme activity was the highest that might be caused by (1) the fish have been infected with some pathogens that result in leukocytes-released lysozyme into plasma be the cause of serum lysozyme was the highest, and (2) any chemicals or homogenizing steps were not used in serum lysozyme method, whereas phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and homogenized tissues steps were used in the tissues lysozyme method that could be interfering the enzyme activities. However, the results from this study are indicating that serum lysozyme is still needed to be used to detection because this technique is easier to sample collection. According to Volpatti et al. ( ), serum lysozyme activity was only used to investigate innate immunity and challenge to Vibrio of Dicentrarchus labrax fed with carvacrol supplementation. Moreover, the samples are not killed, while lysozyme study in visceral organs, the samples are killed. Therefore, serum lysozyme is used as biomarker to monitor environmental variation and contamination (Bols et al. ).
Conclusion
This study has established a baseline data regarding the selected lysozyme activity from three visceral organs and serum in five fish species, catfish, and two carps. The data will be used as reference ranks for these species to evaluate health status when they are exposed with some pathogens or chemical contamination in streams and reservoirs. We recommended that the serum lysozyme is suitable to use for innate immune study in fish.
