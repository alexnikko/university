Introduction
When a pathogen enters the body, the innate immune system mounts acute phase response (APR), in which immune factors are released to contribute removing or fighting the pathogen. The result of this response is series of behavioral and physiological changes in the host such as increase in the number of circulating white blood cell, fever, weakness, and anorexia (Asarian and Langhans ). Anorexia is one the behavioral response of APR, which causes weight loss but helps the host to survive and decrease the mortality rate (Murray and Murray ). This effect is beneficial in the beginning of the sickness but chronic anorexia attenuates host defense and delays recovery and ultimately is harmful (Johnson et al. ).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the constituents of gram-negative bacterial cell wall with the ability to excite (APR), and so acute illness anorexia. Thus, it is used as a standard model for induction of infection (Wisse et al. ). Multiple prostaglandin (PG) systems are activated during (APR) (Johnson et al. ). Inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis decreases anorexia (Naoi et al. ). In rodents peripheral administration of LPS increases PGE2 in cerebrospinal fluids (Lugarini et al. ). The PGE2 receptors are found in raphe nucleus (RN) and cause release of serotonin. It is supposed that serotonergic neurons that project to hypothalamus can cause anorexia via two pathways: (i) by affecting on their receptors on arcuate nucleus receptors and release of the anorexigenic agent αMSH from PMOC neurons and (ii) by affecting on paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and release of CRH and inducing subsequent stress response (Asarian and Langhans ). There is also another PG system in the brain which is activated during pathogenic microorganism invasion: PGD2-NPY system. Centrally administered PGD2 stimulates food intake in mice (Ohinata et al. ). It is demonstrated that PGD2 orexigenic activity is coupled to neuropeptide Y (NPY) which is also orexigenic in both mammals and birds (Jonaidi and Noori ). Considering the importance of food consumption in broilers, understanding the mechanisms involving in illness anorexia is helpful in infectious disease by designing the drugs which inhibit anorexia but do not impair cytokine production and host defense. The key enzymes in PG synthesis are cyclooxygenase (COX), which have two main isoforms of (1) and (2) (Lugarini et al. ). In this study, by applying COX-1 and COX-2 specific enzyme inhibitors in broilers centrally and peripherally, we investigated the role of these enzymes in the illness anorexia.
Material and methods
One-day-old Ross broiler chicks were purchased from a local hatchery (Mahan Chicken Meat Production Complex, Kerman, Iran). The chicks were kept at 24 h lighting and housed in the temperature (29 ± 1 °C) and humidity (40–50%) controlled by electrical heating batteries. They were maintained as a flock, and then transferred to individual cages 72 hours prior to injections. Food and water were ad libitum. Chicks at the age of 7 days were used for intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections. This time is enough for yolk absorption of chicks. Drugs used in this study were as follows: LPS (LG511, Sigma, USA), piroxicam (a selective inhibitor of COX-1 enzyme, Tocris Bioscience, UK), and nimesulide (a selective inhibitor of the COX-2 enzyme, Tocris Bioscience, UK). The drugs were dissolved in a solution containing 0.85% NaCl and 0.1% Evans Blue (Sigma, USA) and DMSO which were used in the control groups. For central injections, solutions were injected in the right ventricle and the volume of injection was 10 μl. We designed three experiments: In the first experiment, the broilers were in four groups ( n = 10 to 12). One group considered as control and the other three groups received piroxicam with the concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μg; the second experiment was similar to the first one with a control group, but the other groups received nimesulide with the concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 μg (five groups). There were four groups in the third experiment: a control group which received a solution containing 0.85% NaCl, 0.1% Evans Blue (Sigma, USA) and DMSO as mentioned before, LPS (100 ng) was injected to the second group this dose was achieved by previous works by our laboratory. Regarding the results of the experiments 1 and 2, the third groups were administered LPS (100 ng) plus piroxicam (50 μg) and the forth group received LPS (100 ng) and nimesulide (10 μg). The ICV injections were as described previously ((Furuse et al. ) and (Jonaidi and Rasooli )). In brief, the head of the chick was held with an acrylic device that holds the bill of the chicks at a 45° angle and the calvarium was parallel to the surface of the table as described previously. A hole was made in a plate. This plate was placed over the skull immediately over the right lateral ventricle. Then a micro syringe was inserted into the ventricle through the hole in the plate, and the test solution was injected. The tip of the needle penetrated only 4 mm below the skin of the skull. This procedure does not induce physiological stress in neonatal chicks (Saito et al. ). Before ICV injections, for having better results, the birds were deprived of food for 3 h, but they had no limitation for water. After injections, feed was given freely and cumulative food consumption was measured at 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min post-injections. Food intake was expressed as a percent of body weight to adjust differences between body weights. We used the following simple formula: $$ \mathrm{Cumulative}\ \mathrm{food}\ \mathrm{intake}\ \left(\%\ \mathrm{body}\ \mathrm{mass}\right)=\mathrm{the}\ \mathrm{amount}\ \mathrm{of}\ \mathrm{food}\ \mathrm{intake}/\mathrm{body}\ \mathrm{weight}\times 100 $$
At the end of the experiments, the chicks were euthanatized by an intracardiac injection of sodium thiopental. Then, the brain was removed and the presence of Evans Blue dye in the lateral ventricle validated the proper injection. The data of birds that the dye was not present in their lateral ventricle were excluded from the analysis.
For peripheral study, the drugs piroxicam (1 mg/100 μl), nimesulide (1 mg/620 μl), and their solvent (saline and DMSO) were administered subcutaneously (s.c) and after 30 min, LPS (100 μg/500 μl) and its dissolvent (saline and DMSO) was injected intraperitoneally. So, we had six groups and there were seven to eight birds in each group. The other process like 3 h of food deprivation and the time of measuring the cumulative food consumption were similar to central injections. The means in all groups at different times were compared with each other using one-way analysis of variance with a general linear model. The significant effects were detected by post hoc tests, Duncan and Tukey. In all cases, significance was accepted at P < 0.05. Data is presented as mean ± SEM.
Results
Our results showed that ICV injection of piroxicam reduced cumulative food intake. This effect was fast and transient, so that after 30 min of injection, it reached significant but disappeared after it (Fig. 1 ). So, we can say that the PG or any agent, which is responsible for eating behavior and is present because of (COX-1) activity, is not produced and so, the outcome is anorexia via a direct pathway.

All doses of piroxicam reduced cumulative food intake after 30 min ( P < 0.05)
Nimesulide had also an attenuating effect on cumulative food intake. Following ICV injection of 5 μg from nimesulide, food intake reduced significantly from 30 to 360 min (Fig. 2 ). About nimesulide, there is the same story, but as the anorectic effect is persisted, there should be activation of other mechanisms or some indirect pathways. Fig. 2 The effect of intracerebroventricular administration of various doses of nimesulide on food intake (g/100 g BW) in 3 h fasted neonatal chicks. Values represent the mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 is considered significant. 5 μg of nimesulide reduced food intake at all time points ( P < 0.05)
LPS decreased cumulative food intake from 180 to 360 min post-injection and this effect strengthens with time ( P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001). As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , the line related to control group is getting away from the LPS one. It means that the anorectic effect of LPS is increasing by a lapse of time. It also shows that this anorectic effect is long lasting and will be continuing hours after injection. As LPS effect started after 3 h, this data suggests that LPS triggers indirect pathways or mechanisms to elicit anorexia. LPS plus nimesulide also, reduced food intake from 180 min to 360 min ( P < 0.05, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3 ). The same result observed for LPS plus piroxicam ( P < 0.05) (Fig. 4 ). Our data showed that central inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 did not attenuate acute illness anorexia but exacerbated it.

In peripheral experiments, LPS decreased cumulative food intake after 120 minutes ( P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Peripheral injection of nimesulide significantly decreased cumulative food intake after 30 min ( P < 0.05). As shown in Fig. 5 , this reduction was more than LPS and started after 30 minutes. So, we can say that nimesulide anorectic effect is more acute and potent than LPS. Both administrations of LPS and nimesulide suppressed cumulative food intake most (30 to 60 min P < 0.05, 120 min P < 0.01, 180 to 360 min P < 0.001) (Fig. 5 ). Piroxicam reduced food intake but it did not reach significant and did not strengthen with time. Injection of piroxicam 30 min before LPS, strongly, reduced food intake after 120 min (120 to 180 min P < 0.05, 240 min P < 0.01, 360 min P < 0.001) (Fig. 6 ). Peripheral inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 did not attenuate acute illness anorexia but exacerbated it.

Discussion
Our data showed that both central and peripheral administration of LPS reduced cumulative food intake. Central and peripheral administration of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors alone also diminished food intake. These effects were exacerbated when they were used with LPS. The anorectic effect of LPS had been shown in previous studies in both mammals (Asarian and Langhans ; Dunn et al. ) and birds (Johnson et al. ; Zendehdel et al. ; Zendehdel et al. ). As mentioned in the Results , the start of anorexia was with a delay of 2 or 3 h that refers to the time necessary for LPS to act on its receptors and activate downstream events which lead to the illness anorexia (Asarian and Langhans ). Our data also showed that LPS anorectic effect was long lasting.
In a present study, injection of LPS compared with LPS and selective COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibitors did not show any significant effect. It means that despite the rodents and cockerels, food intake did not increase in the groups which received LPS plus selective COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Johnson et al. 1993 also showed that central administration of indomethacin a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 had no effect on anorexia caused by LPS in chickens (Johnson et al. ). But how LPS or cytokines stimulate the brain to inhibit eating is not fully resolved. Multiple PG systems are activated during acute phase response (Johnson et al. ). One of them is PGE2. LPS acts on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells and activates the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Several lines of evidence indicate that PGE2 potently inhibits eating (Asarian and Langhans ; Zendehdel et al. ). PGE2 acts on EP3 or EP4 receptors in the raphe complex and causes the release of serotonin (Asarian and Langhans ; Ohinata et al. ). It is shown that ICV injection of 5-HT decreases food and water intake in chickens (Zendehdel et al. ; Zhang et al. ).
Serotonin activates POMC neurons of the arcuate nucleus via 5-HT2C receptors. The subsequent release of αMSH elicits anorexia (Asarian and Langhans ; Zendehdel et al. ). There is also another PG system in the brain which is activated during pathogenic microorganism invasion: PGD2-NPY system. Centrally administered PGD2 stimulates food intake in mice (Ohinata et al. ). It is demonstrated that PGD2 orexigenic activity is coupled to neuropeptide Y (NPY) which is also orexigenic in both mammals and birds (Jonaidi and Noori ; Kaneko et al. ; Richards and Proszkowiec-Weglarz ). One of the signals which activates this system is C5a. C5a is one of the constituent of complement system, which plays an important role in immune responses to pathogenic microorganism invasions (Kaneko et al. ; Law and Reid ). Central C5a stimulates food intake by the PGD2–NPY system (Ohinata et al. ). Central administration of C5a elevated the hypothalamic mRNA expression of COX-2 but not COX-1, and the food intake stimulation of C5a was blocked by pretreatment with a COX-2 inhibitor (Kaneko et al. ). It is noteworthy that C3a, another complement system component, which is also released in immune responses, activates the PGE2-EP4 receptors and suppresses food intake through downstream mechanism mentioned before (Asarian and Langhans ; Ohinata et al. ; Ohinata et al. ). It seems that in rodents and in cockerels the predominant PG system during LPS infection is PGE2, whereas in broilers it is PGD2. COXs catalyze conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2. PGH2 is subjected to different enzymes and produces different kinds of PGs such as PGD2, PGI2, and PGE2 (Rouzer and Marnett ). Different types of enzymes are involved in this stage. PGD2 is produced from PGH2 by lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS) (Kaneko et al. ). The responsible enzyme for pGH2 to PGE2 conversion is microsomal PGES-1 (mPGES-1) which have a selective production by agents such as cytokines and LPS (Jakobsson et al. ). As we observed the suppression of food intake by administration of COX inhibitors, it seems that PGD2-NPY is dominant in broilers. By applying LPS, this effect was reinforced may be because in neonate chickens, immune responses are not fully developed to activate (mPGES-1) and so most of PGH2 goes to the PGD2 synthesis pathway. In rodents, in addition to PG, LPS can acts via another pathway to elicit the illness anorexia; it activates CRH neurons in the PVN of the hypothalamus. Consequently, corticosterone is released and a stress response ensues that it may participate in the development of acute illness anorexia (Asarian and Langhans ). It is shown in birds that ICV and peripheral injections of LPS elevates plasma corticoestron in chickens (Johnson et al. ). As appetite is regulated by central and peripheral orexigenic or anorexigenic agents, may be LPS employ this pathway to induce anorexia too. Further investigation is needed. Here, we tried to bring some data to support a role for COXs in acute illness anorexia by concentrating on the PGE2 signaling pathway in broilers, but it seems that PGD2 or other pathways are involved in the illness anorexia caused by LPS, so administration of NSAIDs or drugs which inhibits PGs synthesis such as aspirin or indomethacin is not recommended for improvement of the illness anorexia.
