Stable Ischemic Heart Disease
Angina is the most frequent initial and subsequent manifestation of coronary heart disease and myocardial ischemia in women and contributes both to the clinical and economic burden of cardiovascular disease. Women with stable ischemic heart disease, however, have a more diverse symptom presentation than do men, with pain or discomfort not only in the chest but in the arms, jaw, neck, and interscapular area; associated epigastric discomfort and associated nausea, and have a different pattern of distribution of non-chest-related symptoms such as excessive dyspnea and fatigue, characteristically referred to as “anginal equivalents.” , , , , , , Women’s ischemic symptoms may often relate to emotional or mental stress and are less frequently precipitated by physical activity compared to ischemic symptoms in men. , , This may explain the longer duration of anginal symptoms in women. The hemodynamic responses to physical activity and to emotion (stress, fear, anxiety) are comparable: an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility with resultant increase in myocardial oxygen demand. However, these subside promptly on cessation of the physical activity, whereas the emotional stimuli persist for longer, increasing the duration of an anginal episode. Further, physical activity is characteristically patient-initiated and terminated, whereas emotional stimuli are predominantly external, not under patient control, which likely accounts for women’s perception of their angina as more severe and more adversely impacting their quality of life.
In the WISE Registry, descriptors of a typical female pattern of chest pain highlight a broad range of symptoms, frequently including both rest- and stress-related symptoms. ,
Anginal equivalents are symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue or weakness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and dyspepia, that can occur in women as manifestations of myocardial ischemia. These symptoms may be vague or hard to describe as contrasted with chest pain. Likely, because angina is a late response to myocardial ischemia and is preceded by diastolic dysfunction and impairment of left ventricular filling followed by systolic dysfunction; this abnormal left ventricular function, particularly an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, may result in dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue (Figure 1 ). Symptoms such as diaphoresis may be explained by the stimulation of autonomic nerves in response to myocardial ischemia. Figure 1 Pathophysiology for anginal equivalents ischemic cascade.

In the BARI 2D trial which compared guideline-directed medical therapies with revascularization strategies in diabetic women and men with stable ischemic heart disease, both angina and anginal equivalents were captured at baseline assessments (Figure 2 ). Essentially comparable numbers of women and men had angina and anginal equivalents, and few had neither. Figure 2 BARDI 2D: Cardiac symptoms by gender.

Acute Coronary Syndrome
Sex differences are equally evident in the clinical presentation of patients with acute coronary syndrome as well. , , Although central chest pain or discomfort is the most frequent presentation, women often evidence atypical chest pain radiations and angina equivalent symptoms such as dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, and indigestion, similar to the sex-differing presentations encountered in stable ischemic heart disease (Table 2 ). Table 2 Typical versus atypical symptoms in women presenting with AMI. Source: Mehta, Circulation 2016;133:916-47 Typical symptoms Atypical symptoms Chest pain/discomfort (pressure, tightness, squeezing) Chest pain: sharp, pleuritic, burning, aching, soreness, reproducible Additional symptoms with chest pain Radiation of pain to jaw, neck, shoulders, arm. back, epigastrium Associated symptoms: dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, diaphoresis Other symptoms excluding chest pain Unusual fatigue Unusual shortness of breath Upper back/chest pain Neck, jaw, arm. shoulder, back, epigastric pain Flu-like symptoms Dizziness Generalized scared/anxiety feeling Generalized weakness Indigestion Palpitations AMI acute myocardial infarction
Pain in the back, arm, neck, and shoulder, as well as unusual sudden fatigue, dyspnea, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, weakness, and a sense of dread occur more frequently in women. Shoulder and arm pain are predictors of an ACS diagnosis for women compared with men (Tables 3 , 4 , 5 ). Variations in clinical presentations and delay in recognition and receipt of appropriate therapies may explain some of the sex disparities in mortality as well as delay times in women seeking treatment. In the GENESIS-PRAXY study, although chest pain was the most prevalent symptom, women were more likely to have added symptoms but less chest pain compared with men. Younger women, age 45 years of age and younger, are more likely to present without chest pain and this clinical scenario is associated with a higher in-hospital mortality. Although young women (here defined as 35 to 55 years of age) have a more diverse symptom range from discomfort or pain in the chest, neck, and jaw, to more generalized symptoms such as sweating and body fatigue, and dizziness, chest pain or discomfort remains the major presentation. Additionally, women reported more nuanced symptoms that might pass, recur, or accelerate over days, weeks, and months before the occurrence of myocardial infarction.

It remains unknown whether major variations in the proposed mechanisms for stable ischemic heart disease syndromes in women are associated with differing clinical manifestations. Myocardial ischemia/infarction in women may have as its pathophysiologic etiology obstructive or nonobstructive disease of the epicardial coronary arteries, microvascular disease, coronary vasospasm or a combination of these processes may be present. Added causes include spontaneous coronary artery dissection and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
In an observational study from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, 1994 to 2006, that involved 481,581 women and 661,932 men, the predictors of MI presentation without chest pain were examined and the relationship between age, sex, and hospital mortality explored. The proportion of patients with MI who presented without chest pain were significantly higher for women than men (42.0% vs. 30.7%, P = <.001) (Tables 6 , 7 ). There was a wider sex difference in younger than in older patients, as the differences became attenuated with advancing age. The in-hospital mortality rate was 14.6% for women and 10.3% for men. Younger women who presented without chest pain had a greater hospital mortality than younger men without chest pain, and these sex differences decreased over time or even reversed with advancing age.
