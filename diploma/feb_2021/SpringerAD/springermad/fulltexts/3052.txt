Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers [ ], and metastatic disease is present in around 30% of patients diagnosed with RCC [ ]. Treatment for metastatic RCC (mRCC) has dramatically changed with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which have replaced cytokines as the standard treatment for mRCC. [ , , ]. In this era of TKI therapies, useful prognostic factors are required for determining effective treatment strategies.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is well known as a representative marker in the acute phase of the systemic inflammatory response [ ]. Previous studies have shown that CRP is a potential biomarker for patients with RCC who were treated with surgery and cytokine therapy to predict their prognosis [ , , , , , , ]. Several investigators, including ourselves, reported that CRP was also a prognostic factor of mRCC treated with TKIs [ , , , ].
Furthermore, the dynamic change of CRP levels, i.e., CRP kinetics, could reflect disease aggressiveness and the treatment efficacy of mRCC. We demonstrated that CRP kinetics was a dynamic prognostic marker for survival in patients with mRCC who were treated in the cytokine era using the baseline nadir model, which was evaluated by the CRP trend by estimating CRP levels both before and after treatment [ ]. Teishima et al. [ ] also reported that decreased serum CRP level after treatment with TKIs was associated with better outcome in patients with mRCC. Their study obtained the retrospective optimal point of the decreased CRP level when computed tomography was performed to clarify the effect after TKI treatment, which was an analysis similar to that of our baseline nadir model of the cytokine era.
As the number of targeted agents increases and immune checkpoint inhibitors are introduced, prediction of treatment response for mRCC would be useful for designing an appropriate treatment strategy. Since it is desirable to predict the prognosis of mRCC in the early period of TKI treatment, this study aimed to explore whether the early response of CRP after the initiation of TKI therapy could predict the prognosis of patients with mRCC.
Patients and methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (Tokyo, Japan), Cancer Institute Hospital Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (Tokyo, Japan), and JA Toride Medical Center (Ibaraki, Japan). A total of 103 patients (80 men and 23 women) were treated with TKIs for mRCC from 2008−2013 at the three hospitals. Overall, 60 (58%) and 43 (42%) patients were initially administered sunitinib and sorafenib, respectively. Fifty patients (49%) had received prior immunotherapy, and 69 patients (67%) had previously undergone nephrectomy. No patient received TKIs in presurgical settings. The endpoints of this study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The follow-up period was defined as the day of initiation of TKIs until death or the last visit of the patient.
The cut-off point of CRP was set at 10 mg/L, with the highest value of ‘sensitivity − (1 − specificity)’ in the receiver operating characteristics analysis using overall death as the end point. Patients were divided into three groups according to their early CRP kinetics—patients whose baseline CRP levels were <10 mg/L (non-elevated), patients whose baseline CRP levels were ≥10 mg/L and had decreased by >20% at 4 weeks after the initiation of TKI therapy (early CRP responder), and the remaining patients (non-early CRP responder) (Fig. 1 ).

The prognostic variables were age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), anemia, prior nephrectomy, prior immunotherapy, TKI administered (sunitinib or sorafenib), corrected calcium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), number of metastatic organs, and early CRP response. For statistical analysis, PS was subdivided into two groups (ECOG PS 0 vs ≥1). As in our previous reports [ , ], anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of <13 g/dL in men and <11 g/dL in women. LDH level was categorized using a cut-off value of 333 IU/L (1.5 × upper normal limit) [ ]. Corrected calcium was considered normal up to 10 mg/dL using the following formula—corrected calcium = total calcium − 0.707 × (albumin − 3.4). The number of metastatic organs was divided into two groups (1 vs ≥2).
Patient characteristics were compared using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to determine the rates of PFS and OS, and differences in the PFS and OS rates were assessed using the log rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis. For all analyses, the differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
During the follow-up period (median 21 months; interquartile range 10–34 months), 69 (67%) of the 103 patients died of mRCC and 1 (1.0%) patient died of another cause. The characteristics of all 103 patients are summarised in Table 1 . The median baseline CRP level was 3.9 (interquartile range 1.0–37) mg/L. The median baseline CRP levels of patients in the non-elevated, early CRP responder, and non-early CRP responder groups were 1.4, 57, and 40 mg/L, respectively. Elevations in baseline CRP concentrations (≥10 mg/L) were observed in 41 (40%) patients. Among these, 19 (18%) patients were early CRP responders and 22 (21%) patients were non-early CRP responders. CRP status was significantly associated with anemia, prior nephrectomy, corrected calcium, LDH number of metastatic organs, and baseline CRP level.

The PFS and OS curves were stratified according to early CRP response at 4 weeks after the initiation of TKIs (Figs. 2 , 3 ). The rate of 1-year PFS and the median PFS for the entire cohort were 40% and 8 months, respectively. The PFS of the non-early CRP responder group was significantly worse than that of patients in the non-elevated ( p < 0.001) and early CRP responder ( p = 0.008) groups. The 1-year PFS rates of patients in the non-elevated, early CRP responder, and non-early CRP responder groups were 50, 23, and 10%, respectively, and the median PFS of patients in these three groups were 12, 8, and 3 months, respectively, which significantly differed among the groups ( p < 0.001). The 1-year OS rate and median OS for the entire cohort were 69% and 23 months, respectively. The OS of the non-early CRP responder group was also significantly worse than that of patients in the non-elevated ( p < 0.001) and early CRP responder ( p = 0.007) groups. The 1-year OS rates of the patients in these three groups were 79, 62, and 36%, respectively, and the median OS of these three groups were 33, 19, and 10 months, respectively, which significantly differed ( p < 0.001).

Univariate analysis revealed that prior nephrectomy, LDH, and early CRP response were associated with PFS (Table 2 ). In multivariate analysis, early CRP response, along with prior nephrectomy, was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (Table 2 ). PS, anemia, prior nephrectomy, LDH, and early CRP response were associated with OS in univariate analysis (Table 3 ). In multivariate analysis, early CRP response was an independent prognostic factor for OS as well as PS and LDH (Table 3 ).

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that early CRP kinetics was associated with outcomes of mRCC patients treated with TKIs. Patients whose CRP level decreased immediately after the initiation of TKIs showed favourable outcomes, compared to the poor prognosis of patients without early CRP decrease.
C‑reactive protein is a significant prognostic factor for RCC patients in various settings including TKI therapy. The current results showed that patients without elevation of baseline CRP levels showed better prognoses. We further divided patients with elevated baseline CRP levels based on early CRP response. The survival outcome was significantly different as a result of this stratification.
The production of CRP is strongly induced by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1, and tumour necrosis factor. Experimental studies demonstrated that RCC cell growth could be stimulated by IL-6 in an autocrine manner [ , ]. Elevation of CRP level reflects the tumour-promoting inflammation in tumour microenvironments. Therefore, a dynamic change of CRP level would represent the treatment efficacy of TKIs affecting the inflammatory tumour microenvironment.
Heng et al. reported that neutrophilia and thrombocytosis were independent adverse prognostic factors in 645 mRCC patients treated with TKIs [ ]. Choueri et al. also demonstrated that increased platelet and neutrophil counts were identified as independent prognostic factors for poor PFS [ ]. Those two studies identified pretreatment neutrophilia and thrombocytosis, which reflect the presence of systemic inflammatory response, as prognostic factors for mRCC patients treated with TKIs. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), another inflammatory marker, could also be a prognostic factor for mRCC. Templeton et al. [ ] investigated the role of NLR changes in patients with mRCC treated with TKIs. They suggested that an early decrease of NLR was associated with better outcomes, although an early increase in NLR was associated with unfavourable outcomes. Hamilton et al. further reported that a decrease in platelet counts after the first cycle of sunitinib was associated with better survival outcome [ ]. These reports were similar to our present study in that early response of the inflammatory marker was associated with the prognosis of patients with mRCC who were treated with TKIs.
Recently, novel agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors have been introduced [ , , ]. As the treatment options are increasing, appropriate selection for sequential therapy would be beneficial and needed in the management of mRCC. Monitoring CRP level would be useful for early evaluation and initiation of subsequent therapy using novel agents in a timely manner.
This study has several limitations. Given the small sample size and the retrospective nature of this study, additional larger confirmatory studies are warranted in order to validate our results. In this report we set the early CRP response as >20% decrease of CRP levels at 4 weeks after the initiation of TKI therapy. Further analysis is warranted for the setting of the optimal definition of CRP response. Although CRP is a nonspecific inflammatory marker, it plays a significant role in monitoring tumour aggressiveness and treatment efficacy.
In conclusion, early CRP response at 4 weeks is predictive of survival in patients with mRCC treated with TKIs, and early evaluation of the CRP response leads to better therapeutic management for mRCC patients.
