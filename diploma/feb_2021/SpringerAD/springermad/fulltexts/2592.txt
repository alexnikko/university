Introduction
Canine parvovirus enteritis (PVE), caused by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2; family Parvoviridae , genus Parvovirus ), is the cause of highly contagious acute hemorrhagic enteritis associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in untreated dogs. Although severe clinical disease mainly occurs in dogs younger than 6 months of age, adults with insufficient immunity may also be affected (Goddard and Leisewitz ; Marcovich et al. )
Canine parvovirus type 2 can survive in the environment for more than a year, enabling the exposure of susceptible dogs to infected feces or vomitus (Sykes ). Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid tissue in the throat and spreads to the bloodstream, wherefrom the virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, leading to the depletion of lymphocytes in lymph. Injuries of intestinal mucosa result in hemorrhagic enteritis and give rise to secondary bacterial invasion from the intestines to blood and organs (Mylonakis et al. ). Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides) elaboration from invading Gram-negative bacteria into peripheral circulation leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and endotoxemia in dogs with PVE (Prittie ; Mantione and Otto ).
The most common clinical manifestations of CPV-2 infection are referable to enteritis including anorexia, weakness, depression, foul-smelling diarrhea, which may range from mucoid to purely hemorrhagic, vomiting, dehydration, and fever. Several dogs demonstrate evidence of SIRS on admission (heart rate > 140 beats/min, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, temperature > 39.2 °C or < 37.8 °C) which lead to a poor prognosis (Kalli et al. ).
Acute-phase proteins (APPs) are considered as one of the most sensitive markers of inflammation. They can be classified according to the magnitude of their increase (positive APPs such as C-reactive protein (CRP)) or decrease (negative APPs such as albumin) in serum concentrations within a few hours following infection (Gruys et al. ). But only CRP was associated with the severity and the outcome of the disease (Kocaturk et al. ).
Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin hormone, is mainly produced by the thyroid C cells. In infection, procalcitonin is produced by extrathyroidal organs including liver, intestines, monocytes, and some neuroendocrine cells. Induction of procalcitonin production, if systemic inflammation is due to viral infection, is low, whereas if systemic inflammation is due to bacterial infection, the induction is of PCT is high (Müller et al. ; Oruç et al. ; Pfister et al. ).
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of canine procalcitonin compared with CRP and total leucocytes count in canine parvovirus enteritis in dogs.
Materials and methods
A total number of 41 dogs of different breeds (13 German shepherd , 5 Labrador , 6 Rottweiler , 5 Golden retrievers , 4 Pit-bull , 3 Mastiff , 2 Boxer , 1 Cane Corso , 1 Great Dane , and 1 Griffon ), sex (25 males, 16 females), and ages ranged from 1.5 to 24 months attended to a small animal clinic, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt, between September 2017 and September 2018.
All dogs under investigation were exposed to a comprehensive clinical examination and were classified into two groups: apparently healthy group was 14 dogs of different breeds (5 German shepherd , 3 Labrador , 3 Golden retrievers , 1 Rottweiler , 1 Mastiff , and 1 Griffon ), ages (3 to 24 months (12.61 ± 1.75 )) , and sex (8 males/6 females)); and the CPV enteritis group of 27 dogs was diagnosed using the Canine Parvovirus Ag rapid kit (Median Diagnostics Inc., Korea), and was of different breeds (8 German shepherd , 5 Rottweiler , 4 Pit-bull , 2 Labrador , 2 Golden retrievers , 2 Mastiff , 2 Boxer , 1 Cane Corse , and 1 Great Dane ) with age ranged from 1.5 to 18 months (4.92 ± 0.77 ) and sex 17 males/10 females. Collected venous blood samples from all examined groups were divided into two parts. The first part was collected on tubes containing ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for hematological assay according to the method described by (Feldman et al. ). The second part was collected in plain tubes for serum separation for canine PCT, CRP, and protein profile analyses.
Serum total protein and albumin concentrations were assayed using reagent kits supplied by the total protein and albumin kits, Spectrum Company, Egypt, with a calculation of globulin concentration and A/G ration according to Kaneko et al. ( ). The serum CRP concentration was determined by a semi-quantitative method based on the principle of agglutination (slide test for C-reactive protein kit; VITRO SCIENT, Egypt) according to the method described by Jensen and Kjelgaard-Hansen ( ). Procalcitonin concentrations were measured by using a dog-specific procalcitonin ELISA kit (Canine Procalcitonin ELISA Kit, KORAIN BIOTECH CO., LTD, China) according to the method described by Goggs et al. ( )).
The obtained data were analyzed using the SPSS software package for Windows Ver. 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and tabulated as mean value ± SE at levels of significance p ≤ 0.001, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤ 0.05. The p value of ≤ 0.001 was considered highly statistically significant.

Discussion
Acute CPV-2 enteritis can manifest in dogs of any breed, age, or sex, but puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months appear to be more susceptible (Dossin et al. ). A severe clinical disease typically occurs in dogs younger than 6 months of age. Breed predisposition and seasonal prevalence of the disease are subject to considerable geographic variation (Kalli et al. ).
The common clinical manifestations in CPV enteritis in dogs include very offensive watery bloody diarrhea, frequent vomiting, severe depression, anorexia, dehydration, and fever which came in accordance with Kalli et al. ( )). Canine parvovirus infection induced destruction of rapidly dividing cells (crypt intestinal epithelial cells) causing disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier, villous atrophy, and malabsorption leading to profuse diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration (McCaw and Hoskins ; Sykes ).
Also, agreed with (Kocaturk et al. ) who stated that the most common clinical signs in CPV enteritis in dogs were fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Intestinal tract damage secondary to viral infection increases the risk of bacterial translocation and subsequent coliform septicemia.. This may lead to the development of a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to septic shock and ultimate death. The mortality rate was higher in puppies that met the criteria for SIRS (heart rate > 140 beats/min, respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, temperature > 39.20 °C or < 37.80 °C) (Kalli et al. ). Most dogs affected by parvovirus had more than two criteria for SIRS (Mohr et al. ; Yilmaz and Senturk ).
Erythrogram profile showed a decrease in RBCs count, Hb %, and PCV % which came in accordance with Goddard and Leisewitz ( ) and Bhat et al. ( )) who stated that in sever phase of CPV enteritis, anemia is a common finding and this may be due to the suppression of erythropoiesis, as circulating red blood cells have a long half-life relative to the short period during which the virus suppresses their synthesis in the bone marrow; also, a decreased PCV might be due to intestinal bleeding, macrocytic hypochromic anemia due to increase in MCV, and a decrease in MCH values which may be due to the damage of intestinal villi capillaries leading to severe hemorrhages and acute blood loss associated with dehydration as mentioned by Sulthana ( )) and Arora et al. ( )). Increased levels of lipid peroxides in erythrocytes and an alteration in antioxidant enzyme concentrations, indicating a state of oxidative stress, may also play a role in anemia pathogenesis (Panda et al. ).
Leucogram findings showed that leucopenia is associated with neutropenia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis in CPV enteritis in dogs which agreed with Goddard et al. ( )), Ling et al. ( ), and Andrea et al. ( )) who reported that the leukocyte count during CPV enteritis is significantly depressed with a transient lymphopenia. The hematological changes are attributable to the destruction of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Leucopenia due to neutropenia and/or lymphopenia is the most prominent hematological abnormality in canine parvoviral enteritis due to the destruction of bone marrow precursors, the depletion of lymphoid tissues, and the increased demands of the massively inflamed intestinal tract (Mylonakis et al. ).
Protein profile showed significant hypoproteinemia along with insignificant hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia in CPV enteritis in dogs which agreed with Schoeman et al. ( ) and Li and Humm ( )) who stated that hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and hyper-alpha-2-globulinemia are present in CPV enteritis. The decrease in plasma proteins throughout the course of the disease is most likely due to a combination of protein-losing enteropathy, intestinal hemorrhage, SIRS-mediated vascular permeability, and subsequent rehydration therapy.
Inflammatory biomarkers analysis showed a significant increase in CRP, a significant decrease in leucocytes count, and an insignificant increase in PCT which agreed with Kocaturk et al. ( ) and McClure et al. ( )) who mentioned that acute-phase protein generation occurs at the expense of albumin generation in critical illness. High serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are positively associated with mortality in CPV enteritis. Also, an acute-phase response occurs in canine parvovirus infection with increases in positive APPs (CRP) and a decrease in negative APP (albumin). Dossin et al. ( ) recorded that leucopenia is one of the prognostic biomarkers of disease severity in CPV enteritis, indicative of a poor prognosis. Also, it agreed with Schültzle et al. ( ) who mentioned that PCT concentrations may be normal or slightly increased in patients with infection due to respiratory viruses. The PCT secretion is nearly blocked due to the increase of interferon (IFN)-γ. Serum IFN-γ levels increase in response to a variety of viral respiratory tract infections. Thus, the absence of an increase in serum PCT concentrations in patients with viral respiratory tract infection may be due to inhibition of PCT synthesis by IFN-γ as reported by Linscheid et al. ( )) and Melendi et al. ( )).
Conclusion
C-reactive protein displayed higher accuracy than leucocytes count and canine procalcitonin as an inflammatory biomarker in canine parvoviral enteritis in dogs.
